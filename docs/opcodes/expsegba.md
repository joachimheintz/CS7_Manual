# expsegba
An exponential segment generator operating at a-rate with
      absolute times.

This unit is almost identical to [expsegb](../../opcodes/expsegb), but more precise when defining segments with very short durations (i.e., in a percussive attack phase) at audio rate.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares expsegba ia, itim1, ib [, itim2] [, ic] [...]
```

### Initialization
_ia_ -- starting value. Zero is illegal.

_ib_, _ic_, etc. -- value after _itim1_ seconds, etc. must be non-zero and must agree in sign with _ia_.

_itim1_ -- time in seconds at end of first segment.

_itim2_, _itim3_, etc. -- time in seconds at the end of subsequent segments.

### Performance
This unit generate audio signals whose values can pass through two or more specified points. The final _tim_ value may or may not equal the instrument's performance time. A shorter performance will truncate the specified pattern, while a longer one will cause the last defined segment to continue on in the same direction.

## Examples
Here is an example of the expsegba opcode. It uses the file [expsegba.csd](../../examples/expsegba.csd).

# scansmap
Allows the position and velocity of a node in a scanned process to be written.

Plugin opcode in scansyn.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
scansmap kpos, kvel, iscan, kamp, kvamp [, iwhich]
```

### Initialization

_iscan_ -- which scan process to write

_iwhich_ (optional) -- which node to sense. The default is 0.

### Performance

_kpos_ -- the node's position.

_kvel_ -- the node's velocity.

_kamp_ -- amount to amplify the _kpos_ value.

_kvamp_ -- amount to amplify the _kvel_ value.

The internal state of a node to write. This includes its position and velocity. They are amplified by the _kamp_ and _kvamp_ values.

## Examples

Here is an example of the scansmap opcode. It uses the file [scansmap.csd](../../examples/scansmap.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the scansmap opcode." linenums="1"

# expcurve
Generates a normalised exponential curve in range 0 to 1 of arbitrary steepness.

It is based on the Max / MSP work of Eric Singer (c) 1994. Steepness index less than 1.0 would result in Not-a-Number errors and cause unstable behavior so is treated as if it were 1.

The formula used to calculate the curve is:

```
(exp(x * log(y))-1) / (y-1)
```

where x is equal to _kindex_ and y is equal to _ksteepness_.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kout expcurve kindex, ksteepness
```

### Performance

_kindex_ -- Index value. Expected range 0 to 1.

_ksteepness_ -- Steepness of the generated curve. Values closer to 1.0 result in a straighter line while larger values steepen the curve.

_kout_ -- Scaled output.

## Examples

Here is an example of the expcurve opcode. It uses the file [expcurve.csd](../../examples/expcurve.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the expcurve opcode." linenums="1"

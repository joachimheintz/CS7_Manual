# cpumeter
Reports the usage of cpu either total or per core to monitor how close to max-out the processing is.

Please note that this opcode is currently only supported on GNU/Linux .

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ktot[,kcpu1, kcpu2,...]cpumeter ifreq
```

### Initialization

_ifreq_ is the time in seconds that the meter is refreshed. If this is too low then mainly figures of zero or one hundred occur. A value of 0.1 seems acceptable.

### Performance

_cpumeter_ reads the total idle time in the last _ifreq_ seconds and reports it as a percentage usage.  If more than just _ktot_ results are requested these report the same value for individual cores.

## Examples

Here is an example of the cpumeter opcode. It uses the file [cpumeter.csd](../../examples/cpumeter.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the cpumeter opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/cpumeter.csd"
```

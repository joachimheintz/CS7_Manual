# rspline
Generate random spline curves.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares rspline xrangeMin, xrangeMax, kcpsMin, kcpsMax
kres rspline krangeMin, krangeMax, kcpsMin, kcpsMax
```

### Performance
_kres, ares_ -- Output signal

_xrangeMin, xrangeMax_ -- Range of values of random-generated points

_kcpsMin, kcpsMax_ -- Range of point-generation rate. Min and max limits are expressed in cps.

_rspline_ (random-spline-curve generator) is similar to [jspline](../../opcodes/jspline) but output range is defined by means of two limit values. Also in this case, real output range could be a bit greater of range values, because of interpolating curves beetween each pair of random-points.

At present time generated curves are quite smooth when _cpsMin_ is not too different from _cpsMax_. When _cpsMin-cpsMax_ interval is big, some little discontinuity could occurr, but it should not be a problem, in most cases. Maybe the algorithm will be improved in next versions.

These opcodes are often better than [jitter](../../opcodes/jitter) when user wants to “naturalize” or “analogize” digital sounds. They could be used also in algorithmic composition, to generate smooth random melodic lines when used together with [samphold](../../opcodes/samphold) opcode.

Note that the result is quite different from the one obtained by filtering white noise, and they allow the user to obtain a much more precise control.

## Examples
Here is an example of the rspline opcode. It uses the file [rspline.csd](../../examples/rspline.csd).
``` csound-orc title="Example of the rspline opcode." linenums="1"

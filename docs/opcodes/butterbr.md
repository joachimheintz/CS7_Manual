# butterbr
A band-reject Butterworth filter.

Implementation of a second-order band-reject Butterworth filter. This opcode can also be written as [butbr](../../opcodes/butbr).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares butterbr asig, xfreq, xband [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- Skip initialization if present and non-zero.

### Performance

These filters are Butterworth second-order IIR filters. They are slightly slower than the original filters in Csound, but they offer an almost flat passband and very good precision and stopband attenuation.

_asig_ -- Input signal to be filtered.

_xfreq_ -- Cutoff or center frequency for each of the filters.

_xband_ -- Bandwidth of the bandpass and bandreject filters.

## Examples

Here is an example of the butterbr opcode. It uses the file [butterbr.csd](../../examples/butterbr.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the butterbr opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/butterbr.csd"
```

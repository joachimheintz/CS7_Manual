# ephasor
Produces two outputs: a periodic phase signal and a periodic exponential decaying signal.

The latter is synchronised to the former, starting at 1 and then decreasing at the same time as the phase signal increases from 0 to 1. The rate of exponential decay can be controlled by the second parameter.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
aexp,aph ephasor kfreq, kR
```

### Performance

_kfreq_ - the rate at which the phase and exponential signals are generated

_kR_ - a parameter controlling the decay rate of the exponential signal, 0 &lt; kR &lt; 1. Lower values produce faster decays.

## Examples

Here is an example of the ephasor opcode. It uses the file [ephasor.csd](../../examples/ephasor.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the ephasor opcode." linenums="1"

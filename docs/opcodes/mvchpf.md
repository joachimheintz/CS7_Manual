# mvchpf
Moog voltage-controlled highpass filter emulation.

Mvchpf is an digital implementation of the 4th-order (24 dB/oct)  Moog high-pass filter, originally written by Fons Andriaensen. According to the author, mvchpf "...is based on the voltage controlled highpass filter by Robert Moog. again with some attention to the nonlinear effects."

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
asig mvchpf ain, xcf[, istor]
```

### Initialization

_istor_ --initial disposition of internal data space. Since filtering incorporates a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of the storage space used is significant.  A zero value will clear the space; a non-zero value will allow previous information to remain. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_ain_ -- input signal.

_xcf_ -- filter
cutoff frequency. The useful range is around six octaves below and above middle C (pch 8.00).

## Examples

Here is an example of the mvchpf opcode. It uses the file [mvchpf.csd](../../examples/mvchpf.csd).

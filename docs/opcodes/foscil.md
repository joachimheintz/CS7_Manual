# foscil
A basic frequency modulated oscillator.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares foscil xamp, kcps, xcar, xmod, kndx [, ifn , iphs]
```

### Initialization
_ifn_ (optional) -- function table number. Requires a wrap-around guard point.  Defaults to a sine wave.
  
_iphs_ (optional, default=0) -- initial phase of waveform in table _ifn_, expressed as a fraction of a cycle (0 to 1). A negative value will cause phase initialization to be skipped. The default value is 0.

### Performance
_xamp_ -- the amplitude of the output signal.
  
_kcps_ -- a common denominator, in cycles per second, for the carrier and modulating frequencies.
  
_xcar_ -- a factor that, when multiplied by the _kcps_ parameter, gives the carrier frequency.
  
_xmod_ -- a factor that, when multiplied by the _kcps_ parameter, gives the modulating frequency.
  
_kndx_ -- the modulation index.
  
_foscil_ is a composite unit that effectively banks two _oscil_ opcodes in the familiar Chowning FM setup, wherein the audio-rate output of one generator is used to modulate the frequency input of another (the “carrier”). Effective carrier frequency = _kcps_ * _xcar_, and modulating frequency = _kcps_ * _xmod_. For integral values of _xcar_ and _xmod_, the perceived fundamental will be the minimum positive value of _kcps_ * (_xcar_ - _n_ *  _xmod_), _n_ = 0,1,2,... The input _kndx_ is the index of modulation (usually time-varying and ranging 0 to 4 or so) which determines the spread of acoustic energy over the partial positions given by _n_ = 0,1,2,.., etc. _ifn_ should point to a stored sine wave. Previous to version 3.50, _xcar_ and _xmod_ could be k-rate only.
  
The actual formula used for this implementation of FM synthesis is _xamp_ * cos(2π * _t_ * _kcps_ * _xcar_ + _kndx_ * sin(2π * _t _* _kcps_ * _xmod_) - π), assuming that the table is a sine wave.

# 0dbfs
Sets the value of 0 decibels using full scale amplitude.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
0dbfs = iarg
0dbfs
```

### Initialization

_iarg_ -- the value of 0 decibels using full scale amplitude.

### Performance

The default is 32767, so all existing orcs _should_ work.

Amplitude values in Csound are always relative to a _0dbfs_ value representing the peak available amplitude before clipping. In the original Csound, this value was always 32767, corresponding to the bipolar range of a 16bit soundfile or 16bit AD/DA codec. This remains the _default_ peak amplitude for Csound, for backward compatibility. The _0dbfs_ value enables Csound to produce appropriately scaled values to whatever output format is being used, whether 16bit integer, 24bit integer, 32bit floats, or even 32bit integers.

0dBFS can be defined in the header, to set the amplitude reference Csound will use, but it can also be used as a varible inside instruments like this:

``` csound-orc
ipeak 0dbfs
```

``` csound-orc
asig 0dbfs, freq, 1
0dbfs
```

The purpose of the _0dbfs_ opcode is for people to start to code 0dbfs-relatively (and use the [ampdbfs()](../../opcodes/ampdbfs) opcodes a lot more!), rather than use explicit sample values. Using 0dbfs=1 is in accordance to industry practice, as ranges from -1 to 1 are used in most commercial plugin formats and in most other synthesis systems like Pure Data.

Floats written to a file, when _0dbfs = 1_, will in effect go through no range translation at all. So the numbers in the file are exactly what the orc says they are.

For more details on amplitude values in Csound, see the section [Amplitude values in Csound](../../)

Example

Here is an example of the 0dbfs opcode. It uses the file [0dbfs.csd](../../examples/0dbfs.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the 0dbfs opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/0dbfs.csd"
```

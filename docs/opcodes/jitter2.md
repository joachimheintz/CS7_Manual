# jitter2
Generates a segmented line with user-controllable random segments.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kout jitter2 ktotamp, kamp1, kcps1, kamp2, kcps2, kamp3, kcps3[ , iopt]
```

Initialisation

_iopt_ -- Optional, controls time of onset of effects.  If zero (default) the output is zero until the end of the shortest kcps value.  If not zero the effect starts
immediately

### Performance

_ktotamp_ -- Resulting amplitude of jitter2

_kamp1_ -- Amplitude of the first jitter component

_kcps1_ -- Speed of random variation of the first jitter component (expressed in cps)

_kamp2_ -- Amplitude of the second jitter component

_kcps2_ -- Speed of random variation of the second jitter component (expressed in cps)

_kamp3_ -- Amplitude of the third jitter component

_kcps3_ -- Speed of random variation of the third jitter component (expressed in cps)

_jitter2_ also generates a segmented line such as [jitter](../../opcodes/jitter), but in this case the result is similar to the sum of three _randi_ opcodes, each one with a different amplitude and frequency value (see [randi](../../opcodes/randi) for more details), that can be varied at k-rate. Different effects can be obtained by varying the input arguments.

_jitter2_ can be used to make more natural and &#8220;analog-sounding&#8221; some static, dull sound. For best results, it is suggested to keep its amplitude moderate.

## Examples

Here is an example of the jitter2 opcode. It uses the file
[jitter2.csd](../../examples/jitter2.csd).

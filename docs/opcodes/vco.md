# vco
Implementation of a band limited, analog modeled oscillator.

It is based on integration of band limited impulses. _vco_ can be used to simulate a variety of analog wave forms.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares vco xamp, xcps, iwave, kpw [, ifn] [, imaxd] [, ileak] [, inyx] \
         [, iphs] [, iskip]
```

### Initialization
_iwave_ -- determines the waveform:

  * _iwave_ = 1 - sawtooth  
  * _iwave_ = 2 - square/PWM  
  * _iwave_ = 3 - triangle/saw/ramp  

_ifn_ (optional, default = 1) -- Must point to a
      valid table which contains a sine wave. Csound will report an
      error if this parameter is not set and table 1 does not exist.
  
_imaxd_ (optional, default = 1) -- is the maximum delay time. A time of 1/_ifqc_ may be required for the PWM and triangle waveform. To bend the pitch down this value must be as large as 1/(minimum frequency).
  
_ileak_ (optional, default = 0) -- if _ileak_ is between zero and one (0 < ileak < 1) then _ileak_ is used as the leaky integrator value. Otherwise a leaky integrator value of .999 is used for the saw and square waves and .995 is used for the triangle wave. This can be used to “flatten” the square wave or “straighten” the saw wave at low frequencies by setting _ileak_ to .99999 or a similar value. This should give a hollower sounding square wave.
  
_inyx_ (optional, default = .5) -- this is used to determine the number of harmonics in the band limited pulse.  All overtones up to _sr_ * _inyx_ will be used.  The default gives _sr_ * .5 (_sr_/2).  For _sr_/4 use _inyx_ = .25.  This can generate a “fatter” sound in some cases.
  
_iphs_ (optional, default = 0) -- this is a phase value.  There is an artifact (bug-like feature) in _vco_ which occurs during the first half cycle of the square wave which causes the waveform to be greater in magnitude than all others.  The value of _iphs_ has an effect on this artifact.  In particular setting _iphs_ to .5 will cause the first half cycle of the square wave to resemble a small triangle wave.  This may be more desirable than the large wave artifact which is the current default.
  
_iskip_ (optional, default = 0) -- if non zero
    skip the initialisation of the filter. (New in Csound version
    4.23f13 and 5.0)

### Performance
_kpw_ -- determines either the pulse width (if _iwave_ is 2) or the saw/ramp character (if _iwave_ is 3) The value of _kpw_ should be greater than 0 and less than 1. A value of 0.5 will generate either a square wave (if _iwave_ is 2) or a triangle wave (if _iwave_ is 3).
  
_xamp_ -- determines the amplitude
  
_xcps_ -- is the frequency of the wave in cycles per second.

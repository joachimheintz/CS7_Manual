# print
Displays the values of init (i-rate) variables.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
print iarg [, iarg1] [, iarg2] [...]
```

### Initialization

_iarg, iarg2, ..._ -- i-rate arguments.

### Performance

_print_ -- print the current value of the i-time arguments (or expressions) _iarg_ at every i-pass through the instrument.

> The _print_ opcode will truncate decimal places and may not show the complete value. Csound's precision depends on whether it is the floats (32-bit) or double (64-bit) version, since most internal calculations use one of these formats. If you need more resolution in the console output, you can try [printf](../../opcodes/printf).

## Examples

Here is an example of the print opcode. It uses the file [print.csd](../../examples/print.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the print opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/print.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like these:

```
instr 1:  irand = 2.930
instr 1:  irand = 0.420
instr 1:  irand = 2.316
```

# grain
Generates granular synthesis textures.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares grain xamp, xpitch, xdens, kampoff, kpitchoff, kgdur, igfn, \
           iwfn, imgdur [, igrnd]
```

### Initialization
_igfn_ -- The ftable number of the grain waveform. This can be just a sine wave or a sampled sound.
  
_iwfn_ -- Ftable number of the amplitude envelope used for the grains (see also  [GEN20](../../scoregens/gen20)).
  
_imgdur_ -- Maximum grain duration in seconds. This is the biggest value to be assigned to _kgdur_.
  
_igrnd_ (optional) -- if non-zero, turns off grain offset randomness. This means that all grains will begin reading from the beginning of the _igfn_ table. If zero (the default), grains will start reading from random _igfn_ table positions.

### Performance
_xamp_ -- Amplitude of each grain.
  
_xpitch_ -- Grain pitch. To use the original frequency of the input sound, use the formula:
``` csound-orc
    sndsr / ftlen(igfn)
```
where _sndsr_ is the original sample rate of the _igfn_ sound.
  
_xdens_ -- Density of grains measured in grains per second. If this is constant then the output is synchronous granular synthesis, very similar to  [fof](../../opcodes/fof) . If _xdens_ has a random element (like added noise), then the result is more like asynchronous granular synthesis.
  
_kampoff_ -- Maximum amplitude deviation from _xamp_. This means that the maximum amplitude a grain can have is _xamp_ + _kampoff_ and the minimum is _xamp_. If _kampoff_ is set to zero then there is no random amplitude for each grain.
  
_kpitchoff_ -- Maximum pitch deviation from _xpitch_ in Hz. Similar to _kampoff_.
  
_kgdur_ -- Grain duration in seconds. The maximum value for this should be declared in _imgdur_. If _kgdur_ at any point becomes greater than _imgdur_, it will be truncated to _imgdur_.
  
The grain generator is based primarily on work and writings of Barry Truax and Curtis Roads.

## Examples
This example generates a texture with gradually shorter grains and wider amp and pitch spread. It uses the file [grain.csd](../../examples/grain.csd), and [drumsMlp.wav](../../examples/drumsMlp.wav).

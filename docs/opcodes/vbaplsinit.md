# vbaplsinit
Configures VBAP output according to loudspeaker parameters.
Configures VBAP output according to loudspeaker parameters.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
vbaplsinit idim, ilsnum [, idir1] [, idir2] [...] [, idir32]
vbaplsinit idim, ilsnum, ilsarray
```

### Initialization

_idim_ -- dimensionality of loudspeaker array. Either 2 or 3.  If the dimension has a fractional part then that is used as the index of the layout created (used in _vbap_, _vbapz_ and _vbapg_ only).  The factional part should be between .00 and .99.

_ilsnum_ -- number of loudspeakers. In two dimensions, the number can vary from 2 to 64. In three dimensions, the number can vary from 3 and 64.

_idir1, idir2, ..., idir32_ -- directions of loudspeakers. Number of directions must be less than or equal to 16. In two-dimensional loudspeaker positioning, _idir_n is the azimuth angle respective to _n_th channel.  In three-dimensional loudspeaker positioning, fields are the azimuth and elevation angles of each loudspeaker consequently (_azi1_, _ele1_, _azi2_, _ele2_, etc.).

_ilsarray_ -- a one dimesional array of the data as described above.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> In 2 dimensions the angle between two adjacent speakers must be less than 179 degrees (170 degrees in earlier versions). This is a restriction of the algorithm.

### Performance

VBAP distributes the signal using loudspeaker data configured with _vbaplsinit_. The signal is applied to, at most, two loudspeakers in 2-D loudspeaker configurations, and three loudspeakers in 3-D loudspeaker configurations. If the virtual source is panned outside the region spanned by loudspeakers, the nearest loudspeakers are used in panning.

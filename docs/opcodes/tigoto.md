# tigoto
Transfer control at i-time when a new note is being tied onto a previously held note

Similar to [igoto](../../opcodes/igoto) but effective only during an i-time pass at which a new note is being &#8220;tied&#8221; onto a previously held note. (See [i Statement](../../scoregens/i)) It does not work when a tie has not taken place. Allows an instrument to skip initialization of units according to whether a proposed tie was in fact successful. (See also [tival](../../opcodes/tival)).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
tigoto label
```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression.

## Examples

Here is an example of the tigoto opcode. It uses the file [tigoto.csd](../../examples/tigoto.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the tigoto opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/tigoto.csd"
```

Here is another example of the tigoto opcode. It uses the file [tigoto2.csd](../../examples/tigoto2.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Second example of the tigoto opcode." linenums="1"

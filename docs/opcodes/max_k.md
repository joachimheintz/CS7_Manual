# max_k
Local maximum (or minimum) value of an incoming asig signal, checked in the time interval between ktrig has become true twice.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
knumkout max_k asig, ktrig, itype
```

### Initialization

_itype_ - itype determinates the behaviour of max_k (see below)

### Performance

_asig_ - incoming (input) signal

_ktrig_ - trigger signal

max_k outputs the local maximum (or minimum) value of  the incoming _asig_ signal, checked in the time interval between _ktrig_ has become true twice. _itype_ determinates the behaviour of max_k:

1 - absolute maximum (sign of negative values is changed to positive before evaluation).

2 - actual maximum.

3 - actual minimum.

4 - calculate average value of _asig_ in the time interval since the last trigger.

This opcode can be useful in several situations, for example to implement a vu-meter.

## Examples

Here is an example of the max_k opcode. It uses the file [max_k.csd](../../examples/max_k.csd).

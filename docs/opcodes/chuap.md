# chuap
Simulates Chua's oscillator, an LRC oscillator with an active resistor, proved capable of bifurcation and chaotic attractors, with k-rate control of circuit elements.

Plugin opcode in chua. This opcode is part of the plugin repository and has to be installed separately. The plugin repository can be found here: [https://github.com/csound/plugins](https://github.com/csound/plugins)

Simulates Chua's oscillator, an LRC oscillator with an active resistor, proved capable of bifurcation and chaotic attractors, with k-rate control of circuit elements.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
aI3, aV2, aV1 chuap kL, kR0, kC2, kG, kGa, kGb, kE, kC1, iI3, iV2, iV1, ktime_step
```

### Initialization

_iI3_ -- Initial current at G

_iV2_ -- Initial voltage at C2

_iV1_ -- Initial voltage at C1

### Performance

_kL_ -- Inductor L (L1 in the diagram)

_kR0_ -- Resistor R0 (R0 in the diagram)

_kC1_ -- Capacitor C1

_kC2_ -- Capacitor C2

_kG_ -- Resistor G (part of the active resistor, R1 in the diagram). The G parameter is the time step, which is needed to get the same slope of the piecewise discontinuity from Ga and Gb for all sampling rates.

_kGa_ -- Resistor V (nonlinearity term of the active resistor, one of the R2's in the diagram)

_kGb_ -- Resistor V (nonlinearity term of the active resistor, one of the R2's in the diagram)

_kE_ -- Size of the piecewise discontinuity simulating the active resistor

_ktime_step_ -- Delta time in the difference equation, can be used to more or less control pitch.

_Chua's oscillator_ is a simple LRC oscillator with an active resistor. The oscillator can be driven into period bifurcation, and thus to chaos, because of the nonlinear response of the active resistor.

The circuit is described by a set of three ordinary differential equations called Chua's equations:

```
dI3      R0      1
--- =  - -- I3 - - V2
dt       L       L

dV2    1       G
--- = -- I3 - -- (V2 - V1)
dt    C2      C2

dV1    G              1
--- = -- (V2 - V1) - -- f(V1)
dt    C1             C1
```

where f() is a piecewise discontinuity simulating the active resistor:

```
f(V1) = Gb V1 + - (Ga - Gb)(|V1 + E| - |V1 - E|)
```

A solution of these equations (I3,V2,V1)(t) starting from an initial state (I3,V2,V1)(0) is called a trajectory of Chua's oscillator. The Csound implementation is a difference equation simulation of Chua's oscillator with Runge-Kutta integration.

> :memo: **Note**

> This algorithm uses internal non linear feedback loops which causes audio result to depend on the orchestra sampling rate. For example, if you develop a project with _sr_=48000Hz and if you want to produce an audio CD from it, you should record a file with _sr_=48000Hz and then downsample the file to 44100Hz using the [src_conv](../../utility/src_conv) utility.

> Be careful! Some sets of parameters will produce amplitude spikes or positive feedback that could damage your speakers.

## Examples

Here is an example of the chuap opcode. It uses the file [chuap.csd](../../examples/chuap.csd).

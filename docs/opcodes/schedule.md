# schedule
Adds a new score event.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
schedule insnum, iwhen, idur [, ip4] [, ip5] [...]
schedule "insname", iwhen, idur [, ip4] [, ip5] [...]
schedule iPar[]
```

### Initialization

_insnum_ -- instrument number. Equivalent to p1 in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i). _insnum_ must be a number greater than the number of the calling instrument.

_&#8220;insname&#8221;_ -- A string (in double-quotes) representing a named instrument.

_iwhen_ -- start time of the new event. Equivalent to p2 in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i). _iwhen_ must be nonnegative. If _iwhen_ is zero, _insum_ must be greater than or equal to the p1 of the current instrument.

_idur_ -- duration of event. Equivalent to p3 in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i).

_iPar[]_ -- event parameters as an i-time array.

_ip4, ip5, ..._ -- Equivalent to p4, p5, etc., in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i). The opcode also accepts strings as arguments for p4-pN.

### Performance

_schedule_ adds a new score event. The arguments, including options, are the same as in a score. The _iwhen_ time (p2) is measured from the time of this event.

If the duration is zero or negative the new event is of MIDI type, and inherits the release sub-event from the scheduling instruction.

## Examples

Here is an example of the schedule opcode. It uses the file [schedule.csd](../../examples/schedule.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the schedule opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/schedule.csd"
```

Thanks goes to David Gladstein, for clarifying the _iwhen_ parameter.

# chnget
Reads data from a channel of the inward named software bus.

Implies declaring the channel with _imode_=1 (see also [chn_k, chn_a, and chn_S](../../opcodes/chn)).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ival chnget Sname
kval chnget Sname
aval chnget Sname
Sval chnget Sname
Sval chngetks Sname
ival[] chngeti Sname[]
kval[] chngetk Sname[]
aval[] chngeta Sname[]
Sval[] chngets Sname[]
```

### Initialization

_Sname_ -- a string that identifies a channel of the named software bus to read.

_Sname[]_ -- an array of named software channels to query.

_ival_ -- the control value read at i-time.

_Sval_ -- the string value read at i-time.

_ival[]_ -- an array of control values read at i-time.

_Sval{}_ -- an array of strings read at i-time.

### Performance

_kval_ -- the control value read at performance time.

_kval[]_ -- an array of control values read at performance time.

_aval_ -- the audio signal read at performance time.

_aval[]_ -- the array of audio vectors read at performance time.

_Sval_ -- the string value read at k-rate. The chnget opcode works both at i-time and perf-time, whereas chngetks works only at perf-time. String variables are only updated if the channel has changed.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Although it is possible to loop through channel names from an array with _chnget_ and _chnset_, using the array based variants is more efficient.

## Example

The example shows the software bus being used as an asynchronous control signal to select a filter cutoff.  It assumes that an external program that has access to the API is feeding the values.

``` csound-orc linenums="1"
sr = 44100
kr = 100
ksmps = 1

instr   1
    kc   chnget    "cutoff"
    a1   oscil     p4, p5, 100
    a2   lowpass2  a1, kc, 200
         out       a2
endin
```

Here is another example of the chnget opcode. It uses the file [chnget.csd](../../examples/chnget.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the chnget opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/chnget.csd"
```

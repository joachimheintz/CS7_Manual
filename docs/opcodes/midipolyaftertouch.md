# midipolyaftertouch
Gets a MIDI polyphonic aftertouch value.

_midipolyaftertouch_ is designed to simplify writing instruments that can be used interchangeably for either score or MIDI input, and to make it easier to adapt instruments originally written for score input to work with MIDI input.

In general, it should be possible to write instrument definitions that work identically with both scores and MIDI, including both MIDI files and real-time MIDI input, without using any conditional statements, and that take full advantage of MIDI voice messages.

Note that correlating Csound instruments with MIDI channel numbers is done using the [massign](../../opcodes/massign) opcode for real-time performance,.  For file-driven performance, instrument numbers default to MIDI channel number + 1, but the defaults are overridden by any MIDI program change messages in the file.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
midipolyaftertouch xpolyaftertouch, xkey [, ilow] [, ihigh]
```

### Initialization

_ilow_ (optional) -- optional low value after rescaling, defaults to 0.

_ihigh_ (optional) -- optional high value after rescaling, defaults to 127.

### Performance

_xpolyaftertouch_ -- returns MIDI polyphonic aftertouch of the selected note during MIDI activation, remains unchanged otherwise.

_xkey_ -- specifies the MIDI key to read from.  It normally should be set to the note number that the instrument instance is playing.

If the instrument was activated by MIDI input, the opcode overwrites the value of _xpolyaftertouch_  with the corresponding value from MIDI input. If the instrument was _NOT_ activated by MIDI input, the value remains unchanged.

This enables score p-fields to receive MIDI input data during MIDI activation, and score values otherwise.

## Examples

Here is an example of the midipolyaftertouch opcode. It uses the file [midipolyaftertouch.csd](../../examples/midipolyaftertouch.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the midipolyaftertouch opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/midipolyaftertouch.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like:

```
i1   127.00000
i1    20.00000
i1    44.00000
```

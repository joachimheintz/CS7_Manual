# eventcycles
Read absolute time in k-rate cycles, since the start of an instance of an instrument.

Called at both i-time as well as k-time. NB: the returned value at k-time starts at 1

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kres eventcycles
```

### Performance

_eventcycles_ is for time in k-rate cycles. So with:

``` csound-orc
sr    = 44100
kr    = 6300
ksmps = 7
```

then after half a second, the _eventcycles_ opcode would report 3150. It will always report an integer.

_eventcycles_ produces a k-rate variable for output. There are no input parameters.

_eventcycles_ is similar to [elapsedcycles](../../opcodes/elapsedcycles) except it returns the time since the start of this instance of the instrument.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> _eventcycles_ acts like [timeinstk](../../opcodes/timeinstk) but it returns the correct values instead of being one cycle late.

# tonex
Emulates a stack of filters using the tone opcode.

_tonex_ is equivalent to a filter consisting of more layers of [tone](../../opcodes/tone) with the same arguments, serially connected. Using a stack of a larger number of filters allows a sharper cutoff. They are faster than using a larger number instances in a Csound orchestra of the old opcodes, because only one initialization and k- cycle are needed at time and the audio loop falls entirely inside the cache memory of processor.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares tonex  asig, khp [, inumlayer] [, iskip]
ares tonex  asig, ahp [, inumlayer] [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_inumlayer_ (optional) -- number of elements in the filter stack. Default value is 4.

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- initial disposition of internal data space. Since filtering incorporates a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of the storage space used is significant. A zero value will clear the space; a non-zero value will allow previous information to remain. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_asig_ -- input signal

_khp_/_ahp_ -- the response curve's half-power point. Half power is defined as peak power / root 2.

## Examples

Here is an example of the tonex opcode. It uses the file [tonex.csd](../../examples/tonex.csd).

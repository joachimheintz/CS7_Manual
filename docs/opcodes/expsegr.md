# expsegr
Trace a series of exponential segments between specified points including a release segment.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares expsegr ia, idur1, ib [, idur2] [, ic] [...], irel, iz
kres expsegr ia, idur1, ib [, idur2] [, ic] [...], irel, iz
```

### Initialization

_ia_ -- starting value. Zero is illegal for exponentials.

_ib, ic_, etc. -- value after _dur1_ seconds, etc. For exponentials, must be non-zero and must agree in sign with _ia_.

_idur1_ -- duration in seconds of first segment. A zero or negative value will cause all initialization to be skipped.

_idur2, idur3_, etc. -- duration in seconds of subsequent segments. A zero or negative value will terminate the initialization process with the preceding point, permitting the last-defined line or curve to be continued indefinitely in performance. The default is zero.

_irel, iz_ -- duration in seconds and final value of a note releasing segment.

### Performance

These units generate control or audio signals whose values can pass through 2 or more specified points. The sum of _dur_ values may or may not equal the instrument's performance time: a shorter performance will truncate the specified pattern, while a longer one will cause the last-defined segment to continue on in the same direction.

_expsegr_ is amongst the Csound &#8220;r&#8221; units that contain a note-off sensor and release time extender. When each senses an event termination or MIDI noteoff, it immediately extends the performance time of the current instrument by _irel _seconds, and sets out to reach the value _iz_ by the end of that period (no matter which segment the unit is in). &#8220;r&#8221; units can also be modified by MIDI noteoff velocities. For two or more extenders in an instrument, extension is by the greatest period.

You can use other pre-made envelopes which start ao release segment upon receiving a note off message, like [linsegr](../../opcodes/linsegr) and [madsr](../../opcodes/madsr), or you can construct more complex envelopes using [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim) and [release](../../opcodes/release). Note that you do not need to use [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim) if you are using _expsegr_, since the time is extended automatically.

## Examples

Here is an example of the expsegr opcode. It uses the file [expsegr.csd](../../examples/expsegr.csd).

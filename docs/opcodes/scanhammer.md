# scanhammer
Copies from one table to another with a gain control.

This is is a variant of [tablecopy](../../opcodes/tablecopy), copying from one table to another, starting at _ipos_, and with a gain control. The number of points copied is determined by the length of the source. Other points are not changed. This opcode can be used to &#8220;hit&#8221; a string in the scanned synthesis code.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
scanhammer isrc, idst, ipos, imult
```

### Initialization

_isrc_ -- source function table.

_idst_ -- destination function table.

_ipos_ -- starting position (in points).

_imult_ -- gain multiplier. A value of 0 will leave values unchanged.

## Examples

Here is an example of the scanhammer opcode. It uses the file [scanhammer.csd](../../examples/scanhammer.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the scanhammer opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/scanhammer.csd"
```

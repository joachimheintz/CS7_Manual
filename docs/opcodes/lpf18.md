# lpf18
A 3-pole sweepable resonant lowpass filter.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares lpf18 asig, xfco, xres, xdist [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- Skip initialization if present and non-zero.

### Performance

_xfco_ -- the filter cutoff frequency in Hz. Should be in the range 0 to _sr_/2.

_xres_ -- the amount of resonance. Self-oscillation occurs when _xres_ is approximately 1. Should usually be in the range 0 to 1, however, values slightly greater than 1 are possible for more sustained oscillation and an &#8220;overdrive&#8221; effect.

_xdist_ -- amount of distortion. _kdist_ = 0 gives a clean output. _xdist_ &gt; 0 adds _tanh_() distortion controlled by the filter parameters, in such a way that both low cutoff and high resonance increase the distortion amount. Some experimentation is encouraged.

_lpf18_ is a digital emulation of a 3 pole (18 dB/oct.) lowpass filter capable of self-oscillation with a built-in distortion unit. It is really a 3-pole version of [moogvcf](../../opcodes/moogvcf), retuned, recalibrated and with some performance improvements. The tuning and feedback tables use no more than 6 adds and 6 multiplies per control rate. The distortion unit, itself, is based on a modified [tanh](../../opcodes/tanh) function driven by the filter controls.

> Before version 6.04 this filter requires that the input signal be normalized to one.

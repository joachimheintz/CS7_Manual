# moog
An emulation of a mini-Moog synthesizer.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares moog kamp, kfreq, kfiltq, kfiltrate, kvibf, kvamp, iafn, iwfn, ivfn
```

### Initialization

_iafn, iwfn, ivfn_ -- three table numbers containing the attack waveform (unlooped), the main looping wave form, and the vibrato waveform. The files [mandpluk.aiff](../../examples/mandpluk.aiff) and [impuls20.aiff](../../examples/impuls20.aiff) are suitable for the first two, and a sine wave for the last.

>  The files &#8220;mandpluk.aiff&#8221; and &#8220;impuls20.aiff&#8221; are also available at [ftp://ftp.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/documentation/sounds/modelling/](ftp://ftp.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/documentation/sounds/modelling/).


### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of note.

_kfreq_ -- Frequency of note played.

_kfiltq_ -- Q of the filter, in the range 0.8 to 0.9

_kfiltrate_ -- rate control for the filter in the range 0 to 0.0002

_kvibf_ -- frequency of vibrato in Hertz. Suggested range is 0 to 12

_kvamp_ -- amplitude of the vibrato

## Examples

Here is an example of the moog opcode. It uses the file [moog.csd](../../examples/moog.csd), [mandpluk.aiff](../../examples/mandpluk.aiff), and [impuls20.aiff](../../examples/impuls20.aiff).

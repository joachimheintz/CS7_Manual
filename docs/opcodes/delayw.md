# delayw
Writes the audio signal to a digital delay line.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
delayw asig
```

### Performance

_delayw_ writes _asig_ into the delay area established by the preceding [delayr](../../opcodes/delayr) unit. Viewed as a pair, these two units permit the formation of modified feedback loops, etc. However, there is a lower bound on the value of _idlt_, which must be at least 1 control period (or 1/_kr_).

## Examples

Here is an example of the delayw opcode. It uses the file [delayw.csd](../../examples/delayw.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the delayw opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/delayw.csd"

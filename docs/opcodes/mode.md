# mode
A filter that simulates a mass-spring-damper system

Filters the incoming signal with the specified resonance frequency and quality factor. It can also be seen as a signal generator for high quality factor, with an impulse for the excitation. You can combine several modes to built complex instruments such as bells or guitar tables.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
aout mode ain, xfreq, xQ [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- if non zero skip the initialisation of the filter.

### Performance

_aout_ -- filtered signal

_ain_ -- signal to filter

_xfreq_ -- resonant frequency of the filter

> :warning: **Warning**
>
> As this filter would become unstable if _sr_/_xfreq_ &lt; pi, the value of the xfreq is limited to sr/pi-sr/100 internally (e.g _xfreq_ &gt; 13596 Hz @ 44.1 kHz). The _sr_/100 term is because the filter while mathematically stable has a very large amplification as it approaches the unstable region.

_xQ_ -- quality factor of the filter

The resonance time is roughly proportional to _xQ_/_xfreq_.

See [Modal Frequency Ratios](../../misc/modalfreq) for frequency ratios of real instruments which can be used to determine the values of _xfreq_.

## Examples

Here is an example of the mode opcode. It uses the file [mode.csd](../../examples/mode.csd).

# printks2
Prints a new value every time a control variable changes using a printf() style syntax.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
printks2 "string", kval
```

### Initialization

_"string"_ -- the text string to be used as a format.

### Performance

_kval_ -- signal to be printed. The style of printing is specified in _&#8220;string&#8221;_ with the standard C value specifier (%f, %d, etc.).

### Print Output Formatting

All standard C language printf() control characters may be used. For example, if _kval1_ = 153.26789 then some common formatting options are:

1. %f prints with full precision: 153.26789
2. %5.2f prints: 153.26
3. %d prints integers-only: 153
4. %c treats _kval1_ as an ascii character code.

In addition to all the printf() codes, printks2 supports these useful character codes:

| printks Code            | Character Code          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| \\\\r, \\\\R, %r, or %R | return character (\r)   |
| \\\\n, \\\\N, %n, %N    | newline character (\n)  |
| \\\\t, \\\\T, %t, or %T | tab character (\t)      |
| %!                      | semicolon character (;) This was needed because a “;” is interpreted as a comment. |
| ^                       | escape character (0x1B) |
| ^ ^                     | caret character (^)     |
| ~                       | ESC[ (escape+[ is the escape sequence for ANSI consoles) |
| ~~                      | tilde (~)               |

For more information about printf() formatting, consult any C language documentation.

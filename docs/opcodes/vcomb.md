# vcomb
Variably reverberates an input signal with a &#8220;colored&#8221; frequency response.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares vcomb asig, krvt, xlpt, imaxlpt [, iskip] [, insmps]
```

### Initialization

_imaxlpt_ -- maximum loop time for _klpt_

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- initial disposition of delay-loop data space (cf. [reson](../../opcodes/reson)). The default value is 0.

_insmps_ (optional, default=0) -- delay amount, as a number of samples.

### Performance

_krvt_ -- the reverberation time (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude).

_xlpt_ -- variable loop time in seconds, same as _ilpt_ in _comb_.  Loop time can be as large as _imaxlpt_.

This filter reiterates input with an echo density determined by loop time _xlpt_. The attenuation rate is independent and is determined by _krvt_, the reverberation time (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude). Output will appear only after _ilpt_ seconds.

## Examples

Here is an example of the vcomb opcode. It uses the file [vcomb.csd](../../examples/vcomb.csd).

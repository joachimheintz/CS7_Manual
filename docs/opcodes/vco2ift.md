# vco2ift
Returns a table number at i-time for a given oscillator frequency and wavform.

_vco2ift_ is the same as  [vco2ft](../../opcodes/vco2ft) , but works at i-time. It is suitable for use with opcodes that expect an i-rate table number (for example,  [oscili](../../opcodes/oscili) ).


## Syntax
```csound-orc
ifn vco2ift icps, iwave [, inyx]
```

### Initialization
_ifn_ -- the ftable number.


_icps_ --  frequency in Hz. Zero and negative values are allowed. However, if the absolute value exceeds  [sr](../../opcodes/sr) /2 (or _sr_ * _inyx_), the selected table will contain silence.


_iwave_ -- the waveform for which table number is to be selected. Allowed values are:

* 0: sawtooth
* 1: 4 * x * (1 - x)   (integrated sawtooth)
* 2: pulse (not normalized)
* 3: square wave
* 4: triangle

Additionally, negative _iwave_ values select user defined waveforms (see also  [vco2init](../../opcodes/vco2init) ).

_inyx_ (optional, default=0.5) -- bandwidth of the generated waveform, as percentage (0 to 1) of the sample rate. The expected range is 0 to 0.5 (i.e. up to  [sr](../../opcodes/sr) /2), other values are limited to the allowed range.

Setting _inyx_ to 0.25 (_sr_/4), or 0.3333 (_sr_/3) can produce a “fatter” sound in some cases, although it is more likely to reduce quality.

## Examples
Here is an example of the vco2ift opcode. It uses the file [vco2ift.csd](../../examples/vco2ift.csd).
``` csound-orc title="Example of the vco2ift opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/vco2ift.csd"
```
Its output should include a line like these:

```
    instr 1:  ifn = 22.000
    instr 1:  ifn = 8.000
    instr 1:  ifn = 3.000
```

See the example for the  [vco2](../../opcodes/vco2)  opcode too.

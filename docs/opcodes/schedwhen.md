# schedwhen
Adds a new score event.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
schedwhen ktrigger, kinsnum, kwhen, kdur [, ip4] [, ip5] [...]
schedwhen ktrigger, "insname", kwhen, kdur [, ip4] [, ip5] [...]
```

### Initialization

_ip4, ip5, ..._ -- Equivalent to p4, p5, etc., in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i).

### Performance

_kinsnum_ -- instrument number. Equivalent to p1 in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i).

_&#8220;insname&#8221;_ -- A string (in double-quotes) representing a named instrument.

_ktrigger_ -- trigger value for new event

_kwhen_ -- start time of the new event. Equivalent to p2 in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i).

_kdur_ -- duration of event. Equivalent to p3 in a score [i statement](../../scoregens/i).

_schedwhen_ adds a new score event. The event is only scheduled when the k-rate value _ktrigger_ is first non-zero. The arguments, including options, are the same as in a score. The _kwhen_ time (p2) is measured from the time of this event.

If the duration is zero or negative the new event is of MIDI type, and inherits the release sub-event from the scheduling instruction.

> :memo: **Note**

> Note that the _schedwhen_ opcode can't accept string p-fields. If you need to pass strings when instantiating an instrument, use the [scoreline](../../opcodes/scoreline) or [scoreline_i](../../opcodes/scoreline_i) opcode.

## Examples

Here is an example of the schedwhen opcode. It uses the file [schedwhen.csd](../../examples/schedwhen.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the schedwhen opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/schedwhen.csd"
```

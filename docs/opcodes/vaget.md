# vaget
Access values of the current buffer of an a-rate variable by indexing.

Useful for doing sample-by-sample manipulation at k-rate without using setksmps 1.

> Because this opcode does not do any bounds checking, the user must be careful not to try to read values past ksmps (the size of a buffer for an a-rate variable) by using index values greater than ksmps.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kval vaget kndx, avar
```

### Performance

_kval_ - value read from avar

_kndx_ - index of the sample to read from the current buffer of the given avar variable

_avar_ - a-rate variable to read from

## Examples

Here is an example of the vaget opcode. It uses the file [vaget.csd](../../examples/vaget.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the vaget opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/vaget.csd"
```

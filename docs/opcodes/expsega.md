# expsega
An exponential segment generator operating at a-rate.

This unit is almost identical to [expseg](../../opcodes/expseg), but more precise when defining segments with very short durations (i.e., in a percussive attack phase) at audio rate.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares expsega ia, idur1, ib [, idur2] [, ic] [...]
```

### Initialization

_ia_ -- starting value. Zero is illegal.

_ib_, _ic_, etc. -- value after _idur1_ seconds, etc. must be non-zero and must agree in sign with _ia_.

_idur1_ -- duration in seconds of first segment. A zero or negative value will cause all initialization to be skipped.

_idur2_, _idur3_, etc. -- duration in seconds of subsequent segments. A zero or negative value will terminate the initialization process with the preceding point, permitting the last defined line or curve to be continued indefinitely in performance. The default is zero.

### Performance

This unit generate audio signals whose values can pass through two or more specified points. The sum of _dur_ values may or may not equal the instrument's performance time. A shorter performance will truncate the specified pattern, while a longer one will cause the last defined segment to continue on in the same direction.

## Examples

Here is an example of the expsega opcode. It uses the file [expsega.csd](../../examples/expsega.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the expsega opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/expsega.csd"

# fiopen
Opens a file in a specific mode.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ihandle fiopen ifilename, imode
```

### Initialization

_ihandle_ -- a number which specifies this file.

_ifilename_ -- the target file's name (in double-quotes).

_imode_ -- choose the mode of opening the file. _imode_ can be a value chosen among the following:

*  0 - open a text file for writing
*  1 - open a text file for reading
*  2 - open a binary file for writing
*  3 - open a binary file for reading

### Performance

_fiopen_ opens a file to be used by the [fout](../../opcodes/fout) family of opcodes. It is safer to use it in the header section, external to any instruments. It returns a number, _ihandle_, which unequivocally refers to the opened file.

If _fiopen_ is called on an already open file, it just returns the same handle again, and does not close the file.

Notice that [fout](../../opcodes/fout) and [foutk](../../opcodes/foutk) can use either a string containing a file pathname, or a handle-number generated by _fiopen_. Whereas, with [fouti](../../opcodes/fouti) and [foutir](../../opcodes/foutir), the target file can be only specified by means of a handle-number.

## Examples

Here is an example of the fiopen opcode. It uses the file [fiopen.csd](../../examples/fiopen.csd). Note that the example must be run from a directory for which the user has write access.

``` csound-csd title="Example of the fiopen opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/fiopen.csd"
```

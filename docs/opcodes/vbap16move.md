# vbap16move
Distribute an audio signal among 16 channels with moving virtual sources.
Distribute an audio signal among 16 channels with moving virtual sources.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ar1, ..., ar16 vbap16move asig, idur, ispread, ifldnum, ifld1 [, ifld2] [...]
```

### Initialization

_idur_ -- the duration over which the movement takes place.

_ispread_ -- spreading of the virtual source (range 0 - 100).  If value is zero, conventional amplitude panning is used. When _ispread_ is increased, the number of loudspeakers used in panning increases. If value is 100, the sound is applied to all loudspeakers.

_ifldnum_ -- number of fields (absolute value must be 2 or larger). If _ifldnum_ is positive, the virtual source movement is a polyline specified by given directions. Each transition is performed in an equal time interval. If _ifldnum_ is negative, specified angular velocities are applied to the virtual source during specified relative time intervals (see below).

_ifld1, ifld2, ..._ -- azimuth angles or angular velocities, and relative durations of movement phases.

### Performance

_asig_ -- audio signal to be panned

_vbap16move_ allows the use of moving virtual sources. If _ifldnum_ is positive, the fields represent directions of virtual sources and equal times, _iazi1_, [_iele1_,] _iazi2_, [_iele2_,], etc.  The position of the virtual source is interpolated between directions starting from the first direction and ending at the last. Each interval is interpolated in time that is fraction total_time / number_of_intervals of the duration of the sound event.

If _ifldnum_ is negative, the fields represent angular velocities and equal times. The first field is, however, the starting direction, _iazi1_, [_iele1_,] _iazi_vel1_, [_iele_vel1_,] _iazi_vel2_, [_iele_vel2_,] .... Each velocity is applied to the note that is fraction total_time / number_of_velocities of the duration of the sound event.  If the elevation of the virtual source becomes greater than 90 degrees or less than 0 degrees, the polarity of angular velocity is changed. Thus the elevational angular velocity produces a virtual source that moves up and down between 0 and 90 degrees.

> Please note that all _vbap_ panning opcodes require the _vbap_ system to be initialized using [vbaplsinit](../../opcodes/vbaplsinit).

# moogvcf2
A digital emulation of the Moog diode ladder filter configuration.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares moogvcf2 asig, xfco, xres [,iscale, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iscale_ (optional, default=0dBfs) -- internal scaling factor, as the operation of the code requires the signal to be in the range +/-1.  Input is first divided by _iscale_, then output is mutliplied by _iscale_.

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- if non zero skip the initialisation of the filter.

### Performance

_asig_ -- input signal

_xfco_ -- filter cut-off frequency in Hz. which may be i-,k-, or a-rate.

_xres_ -- amount of resonance. Self-oscillation occurs when _xres_ is approximately one. May be a-rate, i-rate, or k-rate.

_moogvcf2_ is a digital emulation of the Moog diode ladder filter configuration. This emulation is based loosely on the paper &#8220;Analyzing the Moog VCF with Considerations for Digital Implementation&#8221; by Stilson and Smith (CCRMA). This version was originally coded in Csound by Josep Comajuncosas. Some modifications and conversion to C were done by Hans Mikelson and then adjusted.

_moogvcf2_ is identical to [moogvcf](../../opcodes/moogvcf), except that the _iscale_ parameter defaults to [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs) instead of 0, guaranteeing that amplitude will usually be OK.

## Examples

Here is an example of the moogvcf2 opcode. It uses the file [moogvcf2.csd](../../examples/moogvcf2.csd).

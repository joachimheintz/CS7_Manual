# lastcycle
Indicates whether an event is in its last performance cycle.

Whether an event has a finite duration (p3 > 0) or a note is extended via a time extending opcode (like _linsegr_ or _xtratim_), this opcode returns 1 if the event is currently at its last k-cycle. The only sitatuation where _lastcycle_ does not detect that the event will not run for another cycle is when the note is turned off by another event (using _turnoff2_) and is not given the possibility of running through its release stage (using _turnoff2 instrnum, imode, 0_)

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kflag lastcycle
```

### Performance

_kflag_ -- indicates whether the note is in its _last cycle_. (1 if this the last cycle, otherwise 0)

This opcode is useful for performing cleanup actions, signaling to other events that this event is finishing, etc. It works only at performance time.

## Examples

Here is an example of the lastcycle opcode. It uses the file [lastcycle.csd](../../examples/lastcycle.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the lastcycle opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/lastcycle.csd"
```

# jitter
Generates a segmented line whose segments are randomly generated.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kout jitter kamp, kcpsMin, kcpsMax
```

### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of jitter deviation

_kcpsMin_ -- Minimum speed of random frequency variations (expressed in cps)

_kcpsMax_ -- Maximum speed of random frequency variations (expressed in cps)

_jitter_ generates a segmented line whose segments are randomly generated inside the +kamp and -kamp interval. Duration of each segment is a random value generated according to kcpsmin and kcpsmax values.

_jitter_ can be used to make more natural and &#8220;analog-sounding&#8221; some static, dull sound. For best results, it is suggested to keep its amplitude moderate.

## Examples

Here is an example of the jitter opcode. It uses the file [jitter.csd](../../examples/jitter.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the jitter opcode." linenums="1"

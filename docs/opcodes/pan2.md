# pan2
Distribute an audio signal across two channels with a choice of methods.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
a1, a2 pan2 asig, xp [, imode]
```

### Initialization

_imode_ (optional) -- mode of the stereo positioning algorithm. 0 signifies equal power (harmonic) panning, 1 means the square root method, 2 means simple linear and 3 means an alternative equal-power pan (based on an UDO). The default value is 0.

### Performance

_pan2_ takes an input signal _asig_ and distributes it across two outputs (essentially stereo speakers) according to the control _xp_ which can be k- or a-rate. A zero value for _xp_ indicates hard left, and a 1 is hard right.

## Example

Here is an example of the pan2 opcodes. It uses the file [pan2.csd](../../examples/pan2.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the pan2 opcodes." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/pan2.csd"
```

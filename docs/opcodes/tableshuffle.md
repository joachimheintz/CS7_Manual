# tableshuffle
Shuffles the content of a function table.

Each element of the source table is put into a different random position, without loosing any of them. Imagine shuffling a deck of cards. Each element of the table is copied to a different random position. If that position was already chosen before then the next free position is chosen. The length of the table remains the same.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
tableshuffle ktablenum
tableshufflei itablenum
```

### Performance

_ktablenum_ or _itablenum_
-- the number of the table to shuffle.

## Examples

Here is an example of the tableshuffle opcode. It uses the file [tableshuffle.csd](../../examples/tableshuffle.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the tableshuffle opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/tableshuffle.csd"
```

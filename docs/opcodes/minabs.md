# minabs
Produces a signal that is the minimum of the absolute values of any number of input signals.

The _minabs_ opcode takes any number of a-rate or k-rate signals as input (all of the same rate), and outputs a signal at the same rate that is the minimum of all of the inputs.  It is identical to the _min_ opcode except that it takes the absolute value of each input before comparing them.  Therefore, the output is always non-negative.    For a-rate signals, the inputs are compared one sample at a time (i.e. _minabs_ does not scan an entire ksmps period of a signal for its local minimum as the _max_k_ opcode does).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
amin minabs ain1, ain2 [, ain3] [, ain4] [...]
kmin minabs kin1, kin2 [, kin3] [, kin4] [...]
```

### Performance

_ain1, ain2, ..._ --  a-rate signals to be compared.

_kin1, kin2, ..._ --  k-rate signals to be compared.

## Examples

Here is an example of the minabs opcode. It uses the file [minabs.csd](../../examples/minabs.csd).

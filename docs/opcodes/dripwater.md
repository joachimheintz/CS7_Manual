# dripwater
Semi-physical model of a water drop.

It is one of the PhISEM percussion opcodes. PhISEM (Physically Informed Stochastic Event Modeling) is an algorithmic approach for simulating collisions of multiple independent sound producing objects.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares dripwater kamp, idettack [, inum] [, idamp] [, imaxshake] [, ifreq] \
               [, ifreq1] [, ifreq2]
```

### Initialization

_idettack_ -- period of time over which all sound is stopped

_inum_ (optional) -- The number of beads, teeth, bells, timbrels, etc.  If zero, the default value is 10.

_idamp_ (optional) -- the damping factor, as part of this equation:

```
damping_amount = 0.996 + (idamp * 0.002)
```

The default _damping_amount_ is 0.996 which means that the default value of _idamp_ is 0. The maximum _damping_amount_ is 1.0 (no damping). This means the maximum value for _idamp_ is 2.0.

The recommended range for _idamp_ is usually below 75% of the maximum value. Rasmus Ekman suggests a range of 1.4-1.75. He also suggests a maximum value of 1.9 instead of the theoretical limit of 2.0.

_imaxshake_ (optional, default=0) -- amount of energy to add back into the system. The value should be in range 0 to 1.

_ifreq_ (optional) -- the main resonant frequency. The default value is 450.

_ifreq1_ (optional) -- the first resonant frequency. The default value is 600.

_ifreq2_ (optional) -- the second resonant frequency. The default value is 750.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of output.  Note: As these instruments are stochastic, this is only an approximation.

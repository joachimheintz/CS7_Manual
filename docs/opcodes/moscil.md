# moscil
Sends a stream of the MIDI notes.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
moscil kchn, knum, kvel, kdur, kpause
```

### Performance

_kchn_ -- MIDI channel number (1-16)

_knum_ -- note number (0-127)

_kvel_ -- velocity (0-127)

_kdur_ -- note duration in seconds

_kpause_ -- pause duration after each noteoff and before new note in seconds

_moscil_ and [midion](../../opcodes/midion) are the most powerful MIDI OUT opcodes. _moscil_ (MIDI oscil) plays a stream of notes of _kdur_ duration. Channel, pitch, velocity, duration and pause can be controlled at k-rate, allowing very complex algorithmically generated melodic lines. When current instrument is deactivated, the note played by current instance of _moscil_ is forcedly truncated.

Any number of _moscil_ opcodes can appear in the same Csound instrument, allowing a counterpoint-style polyphony within a single instrument.

## Examples

Here is an example of the moscil opcode. It uses the file [moscil.csd](../../examples/moscil.csd).

This example generates a stream of notes for every note received on the MIDI input. It generates MIDI notes on csound's MIDI output, so be sure to connect something.

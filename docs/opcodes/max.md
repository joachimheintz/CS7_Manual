# max
Produces a signal that is the maximum of any number of input signals.

The _max_ opcode takes any number of a-rate, k-rate or i-rate signals as input (all of the same rate), and outputs a signal at the same rate that is the maximum of all of the inputs.  For a-rate signals, the inputs are compared one sample at a time (i.e. _max_ does not scan an entire ksmps period of a signal for its local maximum as the _max_k_ opcode does).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
amax max ain1, ain2 [, ain3] [, ain4] [...]
kmax max kin1, kin2 [, kin3] [, kin4] [...]
imax max iin1, iin2 [, iin3] [, iin4] [...]
```

### Performance

_ain1, ain2, ..._ --  a-rate signals to be compared.

_kin1, kin2, ..._ --  k-rate signals to be compared.

_iin1, iin2, ..._ --  i-rate signals to be compared.

## Examples

Here is an example of the max opcode. It uses the file [max.csd](../../examples/max.csd).

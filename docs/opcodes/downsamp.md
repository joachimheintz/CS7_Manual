# downsamp
Modify a signal by down-sampling.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kres downsamp asig [, iwlen]
```

### Initialization

_iwlen_ (optional) -- window length in samples over which the audio signal is averaged to determine a downsampled value. Maximum length is _ksmps_; 0 and 1 imply no window averaging. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_downsamp_ converts an audio signal to a control signal by downsampling. It produces one kval for each audio control period. The optional window invokes a simple averaging process to suppress foldover.

## Examples

Here is an example of the downsamp opcode. It uses the file [downsamp.csd](../../examples/downsamp.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the downsamp opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/downsamp.csd"

# wgpluck2
Physical model of the plucked string.

It has control over the pluck point, the pickup point and the filter. Based on the Karplus-Strong algorithm.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares wgpluck2 iplk, kamp, icps, kpick, krefl
```

### Initialization

_iplk_ -- The point of pluck is _iplk_, which is a fraction of the way up the string (0 to 1). A pluck point of zero means no initial pluck.

_icps_  -- The string plays at _icps_ pitch.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of note.

_kpick_ -- Proportion of the way along the string to sample the output.

_krefl_ -- the coefficient of reflection, indicating the lossiness and the rate of decay. It must be strictly between 0 and 1 (it will complain about both 0 and 1).

## Examples

Here is an example of the wgpluck2 opcode. It uses the file [wgpluck2.csd](../../examples/wgpluck2.csd).

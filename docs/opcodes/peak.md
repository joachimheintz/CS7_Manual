# peak
Maintains the output equal to the highest absolute value received.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kres peak asig
kres peak ksig
```

### Performance

_kres_ -- Output equal to the highest absolute value received so far. This is effectively an input to the opcode as well, since it reads _kres_ in order to decide whether to write something higher into it.

_ksig_ -- k-rate input signal.

_asig_ -- a-rate input signal.

## Examples

Here is an example of the peak opcode. It uses the file [peak.csd](../../examples/peak.csd), and [drumsMlp.wav](../../examples/drumsMlp.wav).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the peak opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/peak.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
i   1 time     0.00000:     0.00118
i   1 time     0.50068:     0.71418
i   1 time     1.00136:     0.80155
i   1 time     1.50204:     0.89209
i   1 time     2.00272:     0.89209
i   1 time     2.50340:     0.89209
```

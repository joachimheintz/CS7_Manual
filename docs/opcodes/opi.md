# i
Returns an init-type equivalent of a k-rate argument or array element or directly returns an i-rate argument.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
i(x) (control-rate or init-rate arg)
i(karray,index1, ...) (k-array with indices)
```

Value converters perform arithmetic translation from units of one kind to units of another. The result can then be a term in a further expression.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Using i() with a k-rate expression argument is not recommended, and can produce unexpected results.
>
> To get the value from an array element reliably the second form should be used.

# transegr
Constructs a user-definable envelope with extended release segment.

It is the same as [transeg](../../opcodes/transeg), with an extended release segment.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares transegr ia, idur, itype, ib [, idur2] [, itype] [, ic] ...
kres transegr ia, idur, itype, ib [, idur2] [, itype] [, ic] ...
```

### Initialization
_ia_ -- starting value.

_ib, ic,_ etc. -- value after _idur_ seconds.

_idur_ -- duration in seconds of first segment. A zero or negative value will cause all initialization to be skipped.

_idur2,... idurx_ etc. -- duration in seconds of segment

_itype, itype2,_ etc. -- if 0, a straight line is produced. If non-zero, then _transegr_ creates the following curve, for _n_ steps:

```
ibeg + (ivalue - ibeg) * (1 - exp( i*itype/(n-1) )) / (1 - exp(itype))
```

### Performance
If _itype_ > 0, there is a slowly rising (concave) or slowly decaying (convex) curve, while if _itype_ < 0, the curve is fast rising (convex) or fast decaying (concave). See also [GEN16](../../scoregens/gen16).
  
This opcode is the same as of [transeg](../../opcodes/transeg) with an additional release segment triggered by a MIDI noteoff event, a negative p1 [note event](../../scoregens/i) in the score or a [turnoff2](../../opcodes/turnoff2) opcode.

## Examples
Here is an example of the transegr opcode. It uses the file [transegr.csd](../../examples/transegr.csd).

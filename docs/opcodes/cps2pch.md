# cps2pch
Converts a pitch-class value into cycles-per-second (Hz) for equal divisions of the octave.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
icps cps2pch ipch, iequal
```

### Initialization

_ipch_ -- Input number of the form 8ve.pc, indicating an 'octave' and which note in the octave.

_iequal_ -- If positive, the number of equal intervals into which the 'octave' is divided. Must be less than or equal to 100. If negative, is the number of a table of frequency multipliers.

## Examples

Here is an example of the cps2pch opcode. It uses the file [cps2pch.csd](../../examples/cps2pch.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the cps2pch opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/cps2pch.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 1:  icps = 293.666
```

Here is an example of the cps2pch opcode using a table of frequency multipliers. It uses the file [cps2pch_ftable.csd](../../examples/cps2pch_ftable.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the cps2pch opcode using a table of frequency multipliers." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/cps2pch_ftable.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 1:  icps = 313.951
```

Here is an example of the cps2pch opcode using a 19ET scale. It uses the file [cps2pch_19et.csd](../../examples/cps2pch_19et.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the cps2pch opcode using a 19ET scale." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/cps2pch_19et.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 1:  icps = 281.429
```

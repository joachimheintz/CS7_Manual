# wgbow
Creates a tone similar to a bowed string.

It uses a physical model developed from Perry Cook, but re-coded for Csound.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares wgbow kamp, kfreq, kpres, krat, kvibf, kvamp [, ifn] [, iminfreq]
```

### Initialization

_ifn_ -- optional table of shape of vibrato, defaults to a sine table.

_iminfreq_ (optional) -- lowest frequency at which the instrument will play. If it is omitted it is taken to be the same as the initial _kfreq_. If _iminfreq_ is negative, initialization will be skipped.

### Performance

A note is played on a string-like instrument, with the arguments as below.

_kamp_ -- amplitude of note.

_kfreq_ -- frequency of note played.

_kpres_ -- a parameter controlling the pressure of the bow on the string. Values should be about 3. The useful range is approximately 1 to 5.

_krat_ -- the position of the bow along the string. Usual playing is about 0.127236. The suggested range is 0.025 to 0.23.

_kvibf_ -- frequency of vibrato in Hertz. Suggested range is 0 to 12

_kvamp_ -- amplitude of the vibrato

## Examples

Here is an example of the wgbow opcode. It uses the file [wgbow.csd](../../examples/wgbow.csd).

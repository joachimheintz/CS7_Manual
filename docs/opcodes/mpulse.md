# mpulse
Generates a set of impulses.

The impulses have an amplitude of _kamp_ and are separated by _kintvl_ seconds (or samples if _kintvl_ is negative).  The first impulse is generated after a delay of _ioffset_ seconds.  

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares mpulse kamp, kintvl [, ioffset]
```

### Initialization
_ioffset_ (optional, default=0) -- the delay before the first impulse. If it is negative, the value is taken as the number of samples, otherwise it is in seconds. Default is zero.  

### Performance
_kamp_ -- amplitude of the impulses generated  
  
_kintvl_ -- Interval of time in seconds (or samples if _kintvl_ is negative) to the next pulse.  
  
After the initial delay, an impulse of _kamp_ amplitude is generated as a single sample.  Immediately after generating the impulse, the time of the next one is determined from the value of _kintvl_ at that precise moment. This means that any changes in _kintvl_ between impulses are discarded. If _kintvl_ is zero, there is an infinite wait to the next impulse. If _kintvl_ is negative, the interval is counted in number of samples rather than seconds.

# follow2
Another controllable envelope extractor using the algorithm attributed to Jean-Marc Jot.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares follow2 asig, katt, krel
```

### Performance

_asig_ -- the input signal whose envelope is followed

_katt_ -- the attack rate (60dB attack time in seconds)

_krel_ -- the decay rate (60dB decay time in seconds)

The output tracks the amplitude envelope of the input signal. The rate at which the output grows to follow the signal is controlled by the _katt_, and the rate at which it decreases in response to a lower amplitude, is controlled by the _krel_. This gives a smoother envelope than _follow_.

## Examples

Here is an example of the follow2 opcode. It uses the file [follow2.csd](../../examples/follow2.csd), and [drumsMlp.wav](../../examples/drumsMlp.wav).

# chano
Send data to a channel of the outward software bus.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
chano kval, kchan
chano aval, kchan
```

### Performance

_xval_ --- value to transmit

_kchan_ -- a positive integer that indicates which channel of the software bus to write

Note that the inward and outward software busses are independent, and are not mixer buses.  Also the k-rate and a-rate busses are independent.  The last value remains until a new value is written.  There is no imposed limit to the number of busses but they use memory so small numbers are to be preferred.

Example

The example shows the software bus being used as an output audio channel. It assumes that an external program that has access to the API is receiving the values.

``` csound-orc linenums="1"
sr = 44100
kr = 100
ksmps = 1

instr   1
    a1   oscil     p4, p5, 100
         chano     1, a1
endin
```

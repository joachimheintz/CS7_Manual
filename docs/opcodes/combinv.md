# combinv
Reverberates an input signal with a &#8220;colored&#8221; frequency response. with a FIR filter.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares combinv asig, krvt, ilpt [, iskip] [, insmps]
```

### Initialization

_ilpt_ -- loop time in seconds, which determines the &#8220;echo density&#8221; of the reverberation. This in turn characterizes the &#8220;color&#8221; of the _combinv_ filter whose frequency response curve will contain _ilpt_ * _sr_/2 peaks spaced evenly between 0 and _sr_/2 (the Nyquist frequency). Loop time can be as large as available memory will permit. The space required for an _n_ second loop is _n_*_sr_ floating or double numbers (usually 4 or 8 bytes). Delay space is allocated and returned as in [delay](../../opcodes/delay).

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- initial disposition of delay-loop data space (cf. [reson](../../opcodes/reson)). The default value is 0.

_insmps_ (optional, default=0) -- delay amount, as a number of samples.

### Performance

_krvt_ -- the reverberation time (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude).

This filter reiterates input with an echo density determined by loop time _ilpt_. The attenuation rate is independent and is determined by _krvt_, the reverberation time (defined as the time in seconds for a signal to decay to 1/1000, or 60dB down from its original amplitude).  Affect from a combinv filter will appear only after _ilpt_ seconds.

## Examples

Here is an example of the combinv opcode. It uses the file [combinv.csd](../../examples/combinv.csd).

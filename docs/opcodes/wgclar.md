# wgclar
Creates a tone similar to a clarinet.

It uses a physical model developed from Perry Cook, but re-coded for Csound.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares wgclar kamp, kfreq, kstiff, iatt, idetk, kngain, kvibf, kvamp \
            [, ifn] [, iminfreq]
```

### Initialization

_iatt_ -- time in seconds to reach full blowing pressure. 0.1 seems to correspond to reasonable playing. A longer time gives a definite initial wind sound.

_idetk_ -- time in seconds taken to stop blowing. 0.1 is a smooth ending

_ifn_ (optional) -- table of shape of vibrato, defaults yo te usual sine table.

_iminfreq_ (optional) -- lowest frequency at which the instrument will play. If it is omitted it is taken to be the same as the initial _kfreq_. If _iminfreq_ is negative, initialization will be skipped.

### Performance

A note is played on a clarinet-like instrument, with the arguments as below.

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of note.

_kfreq_ -- Frequency of note played.

_kstiff_ -- a stiffness parameter for the reed. Values should be negative, and about -0.3. The useful range is approximately -0.44 to -0.18.

_kngain_ -- amplitude of the noise component, about 0 to 0.5

_kvibf_ -- frequency of vibrato in Hertz. Suggested range is 0 to 12

_kvamp_ -- amplitude of the vibrato

## Examples

Here is an example of the wgclar opcode. It uses the file [wgclar.csd](../../examples/wgclar.csd).

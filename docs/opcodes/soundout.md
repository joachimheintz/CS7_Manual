## Syntax
``` csound-orc
soundout  asig1, ifilcod [, iformat]
```

### Initialization

_ifilcod_ -- integer or character-string denoting the destination soundfile name. An integer denotes the file soundin.filcod; a character-string (in double quotes, spaces permitted) gives the filename itself, optionally a full pathname. If not a full path, the named file is sought first in the current directory, then in that given by the environment variable [SSDIR](../../command/environment) (if defined) then by [SFDIR](../../command/environment). See also [GEN01](../../scoregens/gen01).

_iformat_ (optional, default=0) -- specifies the audio data file format:

*  1 = 8-bit signed char (high-order 8 bits of a 16-bit integer)
*  2 = 8-bit A-law bytes
*  3 = 8-bit U-law bytes
*  4 = 16-bit short integers
*  5 = 32-bit long integers
*  6 = 32-bit floats

If _iformat_ = 0 it is taken from the soundfile header, and if no header from the Csound [-o](../../) command-line flag. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_soundout_ writes audio output to a disk file.

# ctrl7
Allows a floating-point 7-bit MIDI signal scaled with a minimum and a maximum range.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
idest ctrl7 ichan, ictlno, imin, imax [, ifn]
kdest ctrl7 ichan, ictlno, kmin, kmax [, ifn]
adest ctrl7 ichan, ictlno, kmin, kmax [, ifn] [, icutoff]
```

### Initialization

_idest_ -- output signal

_ichan_ -- MIDI channel (1-16)

_ictlno_ -- MIDI controller number (0-127)

_imin_ -- user-defined minimum floating-point value of output

_imax_ -- user-defined maximum floating-point value of output

_ifn_ (optional) -- table to be read when indexing is required. Table must be normalized. Output is scaled according to _imax_ and _imin_ val.

_icutoff_ (optional) -- low pass filter cut-off frequency for smoothing a-rate output.

### Performance

_kdest, adest_ -- output signal

_kmin_ -- user-defined minimum floating-point value of output

_kmax_ -- user-defined maximum floating-point value of output

_ctrl7_ (i- and k-rate 7 bit MIDI control) allows a floating-point 7-bit MIDI signal scaled with a minimum and a maximum range. It also allows optional non-interpolated table indexing. Minimum and maximum values can be varied at k-rate.

_ctrl7_ differs from [midic7](../../opcodes/midic7) because it can be included in score-oriented instruments without Csound crashes. It also needs the additional parameter _ichan_ containing the MIDI channel of the controller.

The a-rate version of _ctrl7_ outputs an a-rate variable, which is low-pass filtered (smoothed). It contains an optional _icutoff_ parameter, to set the cutoff frecuency for the low-pass filter. The default is 5.

## Examples

Here is an example of the ctrl7 opcode. It uses the file [ctrl7.csd](../../examples/ctrl7.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the ctrl7 opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/ctrl7.csd"
```

> :memo: **Note**
>
> ctrl7 only outputs k values once the controller is first moved. To set an initial k-value, a call to initc7 is required. Ctrlinit does not work for this purpose.

New in Csound version 3.47

Thanks goes to Rasmus Ekman for pointing out the correct MIDI channel and controller number ranges.

The a-rate version of _ctrl7_ was added in version 5.06

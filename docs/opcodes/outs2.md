# outs2
Writes samples to stereo channel 2 of an external device or stream.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
outs2 asig
```

### Performance

Sends audio samples to an accumulating output buffer (created at the beginning of performance) which serves to collect the output of all active instruments before the sound is written to disk. There can be any number of these output units in an instrument.

The type (mono, stereo, quad, hex, or oct) should agree with [nchnls](../../opcodes/nchnls). But as of version 3.50, Csound will attempt to change an incorrect opcode to agree with the _nchnls_ statement. Opcodes can be chosen to direct sound to any particular channel: _outs1_ sends to stereo channel 1, _outq3_ to quad channel 3, etc.

## Examples

Here is an example of the outs2 opcode. It uses the file [outs2.csd](../../examples/outs2.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the outs2 opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/outs2.csd"
```

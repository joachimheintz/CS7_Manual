# linen
Applies a straight line rise and decay pattern to an input amp signal.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares linen xamp, irise, idur, idec
kres linen kamp, irise, idur, idec
```

### Initialization

_irise_ -- rise time in seconds. A zero or negative value signifies no rise modification.

_idur_ -- overall duration in seconds. A zero or negative value will cause initialization to be skipped.

_idec_ -- decay time in seconds. Zero means no decay. An _idec_ &gt; _idur_ will cause a truncated decay.

### Performance

_kamp, xamp_ -- input amplitude signal.

Rise modifications are applied for the first _irise_ seconds, and decay from time _idur - idec_. If these periods are separated in time there will be a steady state during which _amp_ will be unmodified. If _linen_ rise and decay periods overlap then both modifications will be in effect for that time. If the overall duration _idur_ is exceeded in performance, the final decay will continue on in the same direction, going negative.

> A common error with this opcode is to assume that the value of 0 is the held after the envelope has finished at _idur_. _linen_ does not automatically end or stop at the end of the duration given. If your note length is longer than _idur_ seconds, _kres_ (or _ares_) will not come to rest at 0, but will instead continue to fall with the same rate. If a decay and then hold is required then the [linseg](../../opcodes/linseg) opcode should be considered instead.

## Examples

Here is an example of the linen opcode. It uses the file [linen.csd](../../examples/linen.csd).

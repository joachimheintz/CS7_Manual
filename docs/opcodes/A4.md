# A4
Sets the base frequency for pitch A4.

These statements are global value [assignments](../../opcodes/assign), made 
at the beginning of an orchestra, before any instrument block is defined. Their function is to set certain [reserved symbol variables](../../) that are required for performance. Once set, these reserved symbols can be used in expressions anywhere in the orchestra.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
A4 = iarg
```

### Initialization

_A4_  = (optional) -- set reference frequency for pitch A4 to _iarg_ Hertz. The default value is 440.

In addition, any [global variable](../../) can be initialized by an _init-time assignment_ anywhere before the first [instr statement](../../opcodes/instr).  All of the above assignments are run as instrument 0 (i-pass only) at the start of real performance.

Beginning with Csound version 6.08, _A4_ may be used.  It affects the behaviour of the opcodes _cpspch_, _cpsoct_, _cps2pch_, _cpsxpch_ and _cpsmidinn_.

## Examples

Here is an example of the A4 opcode. It uses the file [A4.csd](../../examples/A4.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the A4 opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/A4.csd"

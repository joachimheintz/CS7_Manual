# vco2ft
Returns a table number at k-time for a given oscillator frequency and wavform.

_vco2ft_ returns the function table number to be used for generating the specified waveform at a given frequency. This function table number can be used by any Csound opcode that generates a signal by reading function tables (like  [oscilikt](../../opcodes/oscilikt) ). The tables must be calculated by  [vco2init](../../opcodes/vco2init)  before _vco2ft_ is called and shared as Csound ftables (_ibasfn_).  

## Syntax
```csound-orc
kfn vco2ft kcps, iwave [, inyx]
```

### Initialization
_iwave_ -- the waveform for which table number is to be selected. Allowed values are:  
  
*  0: sawtooth  
*  1: 4 * x * (1 - x)   (integrated sawtooth)  
*  2: pulse (not normalized)  
*  3: square wave  
*  4: triangle  

  
  
Additionally, negative _iwave_ values select user defined waveforms (see also  [vco2init](../../opcodes/vco2init) ).  
  
_inyx_ (optional, default=0.5) -- bandwidth of the generated waveform, as percentage (0 to 1) of the sample rate. The expected range is 0 to 0.5 (i.e. up to  [sr](../../opcodes/sr) /2), other values are limited to the allowed range.  
  
Setting _inyx_ to 0.25 (_sr_/4), or 0.3333 (_sr_/3) can produce a “fatter” sound in some cases, although it is more likely to reduce quality.  

### Performance
_kfn_ -- the ftable number, returned at k-rate.  
  
_kcps_ -- frequency in Hz, returned at k-rate. Zero and negative values are allowed. However, if the absolute value exceeds _sr_/2 (or _sr_ * _inyx_), the selected table will contain silence.  

## Examples
See the example for the  [vco2](../../opcodes/vco2)  opcode.

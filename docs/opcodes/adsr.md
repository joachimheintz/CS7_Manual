# adsr
Calculates the classical ADSR envelope using linear segments.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares adsr iatt, idec, islev, irel [, idel]
kres adsr iatt, idec, islev, irel [, idel]
```

### Initialization

_iatt_ -- duration of attack phase

_idec_ -- duration of decay

_islev_ -- level for sustain phase

_irel_ -- duration of release phase

_idel_ -- period of zero before the envelope starts

### Performance

The envelope generated is the range 0 to 1 and may need to be scaled further, depending on the amplitude required. If using [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs) = 1, scaling down will probably be required since playing more than one note might result in clipping. If not using [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs), scaling to a large amplitude (e.g. 32000) might be required.

The envelope may be described as:

The length of the sustain is calculated from the length of the note. This means _adsr_ is not suitable for use with MIDI events. The opcode [madsr](../../opcodes/madsr) uses the [linsegr](../../opcodes/linsegr) mechanism, and so can be used in MIDI applications.

_adsr_ is new in Csound version 3.49.

## Examples

Here is an example of the adsr opcode. It uses the file [adsr.csd](../../examples/adsr.csd).

Here is an example for the adsr-group, comparing the different adsr opcodes. It uses the file [adsr-group.csd](../../examples/adsr-group.csd).

# elapsedtime
Read absolute time, in seconds, since the start of the performance.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ires elapsedtime
kres elapsedtime
```

### Performance

Time in seconds is available with _elapsedtime_. This would return 0.5 after half a second.

_elapsedtime_ can both produce a k-rate variable for output. There are no input parameters.

_elapsedtime_ can also operate at the start of the instance of the instrument. It produces an i-rate variable (starting with _i_ or _gi_) as its output.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> _elapsedtime_ acts like [times](../../opcodes/times) but it returns the correct values instead of being one cycle late.

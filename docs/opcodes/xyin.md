# xyin
Sense the cursor position in an output window

When _xyin_ is called the position of the mouse within the output window is used to reply to the request.  This simple mechanism does mean that only one _xyin_ can be used accurately at once.  The position of the mouse is reported in the output window.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kx, ky xyin iprd, ixmin, ixmax, iymin, iymax [, ixinit] [, iyinit]
```

### Initialization

_iprd_ -- period of cursor sensing (in seconds). Typically .1 seconds.

_xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax_ -- edge values for the x-y coordinates of a cursor in the input window.

_ixinit, iyinit_ (optional) -- initial x-y coordinates reported; the default values are 0,0. If these values are not within the given min-max range, they will be coerced into that range.

### Performance

_xyin_ samples the cursor x-y position in an input window every _iprd_ seconds. Output values are repeated (not interpolated) at the k-rate, and remain fixed until a new change is registered in the window. There may be any number of input windows. This unit is useful for real-time control, but continuous motion should be avoided if _iprd_ is unusually small.

## Examples

Here is an example of the xyin opcode. It uses the file [xyin.csd](../../examples/xyin.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the xyin opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/xyin.csd"
```

As the values of kx and ky change, they will be printed out like this:

```
kx=8.612036, ky=22.677933
kx=10.765685, ky=15.644135
```

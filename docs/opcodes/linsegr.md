# linsegr
Trace a series of line segments between specified points including a release segment.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares linsegr ia, idur1, ib [, idur2] [, ic] [...], irel, iz
kres linsegr ia, idur1, ib [, idur2] [, ic] [...], irel, iz
```

### Initialization
_ia_ -- starting value.

_ib, ic_, etc. -- value after _dur1_ seconds, etc.

_idur1_ -- duration in seconds of first segment. A zero or negative value will cause all initialization to be skipped.

_idur2, idur3_, etc. -- duration in seconds of subsequent segments. A zero or negative value will terminate the initialization process with the preceding point, permitting the last-defined line or curve to be continued indefinitely in performance. The default is zero.

_irel, iz_ -- duration in seconds and final value of a note releasing segment.

For Csound versions prior to 5.00, the release time cannot be longer than 32767/[kr](../../opcodes/kr) seconds. This limit has been extended to (2<sup>31</sup>-1)/kr.

### Performance
These units generate control or audio signals whose values can pass through 2 or more specified points. The sum of _dur_ values may or may not equal the instrument's performance time: a shorter performance will truncate the specified pattern, while a longer one will cause the last-defined segment to continue on in the same direction.

_linsegr_ is amongst the Csound “r” units that contain a note-off sensor and release time extender. When each senses an event termination or MIDI noteoff, it immediately extends the performance time of the current instrument by _irel _seconds, and sets out to reach the value _iz_ by the end of that period (no matter which segment the unit is in). “r” units can also be modified by MIDI noteoff velocities. For two or more extenders in an instrument, extension is by the greatest period.

You can use other pre-made envelopes which start a release segment upon receiving a note off message, like [linenr](../../opcodes/linenr) and [expsegr](../../opcodes/expsegr), or you can construct more complex envelopes using [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim) and [release](../../opcodes/release). Note that you do not need to use [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim) if you are using _linsegr_, since the time is extended automatically.

## Examples
Here is an example of the linsegr opcode. It uses the file [linsegr.csd](../../examples/linsegr.csd).
``` csound-orc title="Example of the linsegr opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/linsegr.csd"
```

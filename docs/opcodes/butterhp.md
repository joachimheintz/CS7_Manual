# butterhp
A high-pass Butterworth filter.

Implementation of second-order high-pass Butterworth filter. This opcode can also be written as [buthp](../../opcodes/buthp).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares butterhp asig, kfreq [, iskip]
ares butterhp asig, afreq [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- Skip initialization if present and non-zero.

### Performance

These filters are Butterworth second-order IIR filters. They are slightly slower than the original filters in Csound, but they offer an almost flat passband and very good precision and stopband attenuation.

_asig_ -- Input signal to be filtered.

_kfreq_/_afreq_ -- Cutoff or center frequency for each of the filters.

## Examples

Here is an example of the butterhp opcode. It uses the file [butterhp.csd](../../examples/butterhp.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the butterhp opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/butterhp.csd"
```

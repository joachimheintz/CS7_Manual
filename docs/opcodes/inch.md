# inch
Reads from numbered channels in an external audio signal or stream.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ain1[, ...] inch kchan1[,...]
```

### Performance

_ain1, ..._ - input audio signals

_kchan1,..._ - channel numbers

_inch_ reads from numbered channels determined by the corresponding _kchan_ into the associated _ain_. If the command-line [-i](../../) flag is set, sound is read continuously from the audio input stream (e.g. _stdin_ or a soundfile). _inch_ can also be used to receive audio in realtime from the audio interface using _-iadc_.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> The highest number for _kchan_ available for use with _inch_ depends on [nchnls_i](../../opcodes/nchnls_i). If _kchan_ is greater than _nchnls_i_, _ain_ will be silent. Note that _inch_ will give a warning but not an error in this case.

## Examples

Here is an example of the inch opcode. It uses the file [inch.csd](../../examples/inch.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the inch opcode." linenums="1"

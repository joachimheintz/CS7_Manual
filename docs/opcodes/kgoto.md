# kgoto
During the p-time passes only, unconditionally transfer control to the statement labeled by _label_.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kgoto label
```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression.

## Examples

Here is an example of the kgoto opcode. It uses the file [kgoto.csd](../../examples/kgoto.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the kgoto opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/kgoto.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
kval = 0.000000, kfreq = 440.000000
kval = 0.999732, kfreq = 440.000000
kval = 1.999639, kfreq = 880.000000
```

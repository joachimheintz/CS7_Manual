# mandel
Mandelbrot set

Returns the number of iterations corresponding to a given point of complex plane by applying the Mandelbrot set formula.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kiter, koutrig mandel  ktrig, kx, ky, kmaxIter
```

### Performance

_kiter_ - number of iterations

_koutrig_ - output trigger signal

_ktrig_ - input trigger signal

_kx, ky_ - coordinates of a given point belonging to the complex plane

_kmaxIter_ - maximum iterations allowed

_mandel_ is an opcode that allows the use of the Mandelbrot set formula to generate an output that can be applied to any musical (or non-musical) parameter. It has two output arguments: _kiter_, that contains the iteration number of a given point, and _koutrig_, that generates a trigger 'bang' each time _kiter_ changes. A new number of iterations is evaluated only when _ktrig_ is set to a non-zero value. The coordinates of the complex plane are set in _kx_ and _ky_, while _kmaxIter_ contains the maximum number of iterations. Output values, which are integer numbers, can be mapped in any sorts of ways by the composer.

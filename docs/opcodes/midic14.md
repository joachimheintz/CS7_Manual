# midic14
Allows a floating-point 14-bit MIDI signal scaled with a minimum and a maximum range.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
idest midic14 ictlno1, ictlno2, imin, imax [, ifn]
kdest midic14 ictlno1, ictlno2, kmin, kmax [, ifn]
```

### Initialization

_idest_ -- output signal

_ictln1o_ -- most-significant byte controller number (0-127)

_ictlno2_ -- least-significant byte controller number (0-127)

_imin_ -- user-defined minimum floating-point value of output

_imax_ -- user-defined maximum floating-point value of output

_ifn_ (optional) -- table to be read when indexing is required. Table must be normalized. Output is scaled according to _imin_ and _imax_ values.

### Performance

_kdest_ -- output signal

_kmin_ -- user-defined minimum floating-point value of output

_kmax_ -- user-defined maximum floating-point value of output

_midic14_ (i- and k-rate 14 bit MIDI control) allows a floating-point 14-bit MIDI signal scaled with a minimum and a maximum range. The minimum and maximum values can be varied at k-rate. It can use optional interpolated table indexing. It requires two MIDI controllers as input.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Please note that the _midic_ family of opcodes are designed for MIDI triggered events, and do not require a channel number since they will respond to the same channel as the one that triggered the instrument (see [massign](../../opcodes/massign)). However they will crash if called from a score driven event.

## Examples

Here is an example of the midic14 opcode. It uses the file [midic14.csd](../../examples/midic14.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the midic14 opcode." linenums="1"

Thanks goes to Rasmus Ekman for pointing out the correct controller number range.

# gainslider
An implementation of a logarithmic gain curve which is similar to the gainslider~ object from Cycling 74 Max / MSP.

This opcode is intended for use to multiply by an audio signal to give a console mixer like feel. There is no bounds in the source code so you can for example give higher than 127 values for extra amplitude but possibly clipped audio.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
kout gainslider kindex
```

### Performance
_kindex_ -- Index value. Nominal range from 0-127. For example a range of 0-152 will give you a range from -âˆž to +18.0 dB.

_kout_ -- Scaled output.

## Examples
Here is an example of the gainslider opcode. It uses the file [gainslider.csd](../../examples/gainslider.csd).

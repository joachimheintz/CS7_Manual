# scanmap
Allows the position and velocity of a node in a scanned process to be read.

Plugin opcode in scansyn.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kpos, kvel scanmap iscan, kamp, kvamp [, iwhich]
```

### Initialization

_iscan_ -- which scan process to read

_iwhich_ (optional) -- which node to sense. The default is 0.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- amount to amplify the _kpos_ value.

_kvamp_ -- amount to amplify the _kvel_ value.

The internal state of a node is read. This includes its position and velocity. They are amplified by the _kamp_ and _kvamp_ values.

## Examples

Here is an example of the scanmap opcode. It uses the file [scanmap.csd](../../examples/scanmap.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the scanmap opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/scanmap.csd"
```

Here is another example of the scanmap opcode. It uses the file [scanmap_matrxT.csd](../../examples/scanmap_matrxT.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Second example of the scanma opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/scanmap_matrxT.csd"
```

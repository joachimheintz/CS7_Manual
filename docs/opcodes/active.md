# active
Returns the number of active instances of an instrument with options to ignore releasing instances.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ir active insnum [,iopt [,inorel]]
ir active Sinsname [,iopt [,inorel]]
kres active kinsnum [,iopt [,inorel]]
```

### Initialization

_insnum_ -- number or string name of the instrument to be reported

_Sinsname_ -- instrument name

_iopt_ -- select currently active (zero, default), or all every active (non zero)

_inorel_ -- if non-zero ignore instruments in release phase (zero, default), only valid if iopts is zero.

### Performance

_kinsnum_ -- number or string name of the instrument to be reported

_active_ returns the number of active instances of instrument number _insnum/kinsnum_ (or named instrument _Sinsname_). As of Csound 4.17 the output is updated at k-rate (if input arg is k-rate), to allow running count of instr instances.

As of Csound 5.17 if the instrument number is given as zero then all instruments are counted.

## Examples

Here is a simple example of the active opcode. It uses the file
[active.csd](../../examples/active.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Simple example of the active opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/active.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 2:  icount = 1.000
instr 2:  icount = 2.000
```

Here is a more advanced example of the active opcode. It displays the results of the active opcode at k-rate instead of i-rate. It uses the file [active_k.csd](../../examples/active_k.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the active opcode at k-rate." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/active_k.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like:

```
i2     1.00000
i2     2.00000
```

Here is another example of the active opcode, using the number of instances to calculate gain. It uses the file [active_scale.csd](../../examples/active_scale.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the active opcode at k-rate." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/active_scale.csd"
```

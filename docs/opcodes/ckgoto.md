# ckgoto
During the p-time passes only, conditionally transfer control to the statement labeled by _label_.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ckgoto condition, label
```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression, and where _condition_ uses one of the Relational operators (_&lt;_,_ =_, _&lt;=_, _==_, _!=_) (and _=_ for convenience, see also under [Conditional Values](../../control/conditional)).

## Examples

Here is an example of the ckgoto opcode. It uses the file [ckgoto.csd](../../examples/ckgoto.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the ckgoto opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/ckgoto.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like:

```
kval = 0.000000, kfreq = 440.000000
kval = 0.999732, kfreq = 440.000000
kval = 1.999639, kfreq = 880.000000
```

# gendyx
Variation of the dynamic stochastic approach to waveform synthesis conceived by Iannis Xenakis.

_gendyx_ (gendy eXtended) is an implementation of the _Génération Dynamique Stochastique_ (GENDYN), a dynamic stochastic approach to waveform synthesis conceived by Iannis Xenakis, using curves instead of segments.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares gendyx kamp, kampdist, kdurdist, kadpar, kddpar, kminfreq, kmaxfreq, \
            kampscl, kdurscl, kcurveup, kcurvedown [, initcps] [, knum]
kres gendyx kamp, kampdist, kdurdist, kadpar, kddpar, kminfreq, kmaxfreq, \
            kampscl, kdurscl, kcurveup, kcurvedown [, initcps] [, knum]
```

### Initialization

_initcps_ (optional, default=12) -- max number of control points.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- amplitude.

_kampdist_ -- choice of probability distribution for the next perturbation of the amplitude of a control point. The valid distributions are:

* 0 - LINEAR
* 1 - CAUCHY
* 2 - LOGIST
* 3 - HYPERBCOS
* 4 - ARCSINE
* 5 - EXPON
* 6 - SINUS (external k-rate signal)

If _kampdist_=6, the user can use an external k-rate signal through _kadpar_.

_kdurdist_ -- choice of distribution for the perturbation of the current inter control point duration. See _kampdist_ for the valid distributions. If _kdurdist_=6, the user can use an external k-rate signal through _kddpar_.

_kadpar_ -- parameter for the _kampdist_ distribution. Should be in the range of 0.0001 to 1.

_kddpar_ -- parameter for the _kdurdist_ distribution. Should be in the range of 0.0001 to 1.

_kminfreq_ -- minimum allowed frequency of oscillation.

_kmaxfreq_ -- maximum allowed frequency of oscillation.

_kampscl_ -- multiplier for the distribution's delta value for amplitude (1.0 is full range).

_kdurscl_ -- multiplier for the distribution's delta value for duration.

_kcurveup_ -- controls the curve for the increasing amplitudes between two points; it has to be non negative.

* 0: step function (like a sample &amp; hold)
* &lt;1: concave
* 1: linear (like gendy)
* &gt;1: convex

_kcurvedown_ -- controls the curve for the decreasing amplitudes between two points; it has to be non negative.

* 0: step function
* &lt;1: convex
* 1: linear
* &gt;1: concave

_knum_ (optional, default=_initcps_) -- current number of utilized control points.

The waveform is generated by _knum_ - 1 curves and is repeated in the time. The vertexes (control points) are moved according to a stochastic action and they are limited within the boundaries of a mirror formed by an amplitude barrier and a time barrier.

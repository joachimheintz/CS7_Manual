# seed
Sets the global seed value for all _x-class noise generators_, as well as other opcodes that use a random call, such as [grain](../../opcodes/grain).

> :memo: **Please Note**
>
> [rand](../../opcodes/rand), [randh](../../opcodes/randh), [randi](../../opcodes/randi), [rnd(x)](../../opcodes/rnd) and [birnd(x)](../../opcodes/birnd) are not affected by seed.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
seed ival
```

### Performance

Use of _seed_ will provide predictable results from an orchestra using with random generators, when required from multiple performances.

When specifying a seed value, _ival_ should be an integer between 0 and 2<sup>32</sup>. If _ival_ = 0, the value of _ival_ will be derived from the system clock.

## Examples

Here is an example of the seed opcode. It uses the file [seed.csd](../../examples/seed.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the seed opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/seed.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like:

```
i   1 time     0.00067:   100.00000
i   1 time     0.50000:   175.78677
i   1 time     1.00000:   170.89579

WARNING: Seeding from current time 834128659

```

# reshapearray
Reshape an array, maintaining its capacity

Plugin opcode in emugens.

The _reshapearray_ opcode changes the shape of an array, as long as this does not modify its capacity. It can be used to convert a 1D to a 2D array, or viceversa, or simply to modify the size of its dimensions, as long as the product remains constant.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
reshapearray array[], isize0 [, isize1 ]
```

### Initialization

_array[]_ - The array to be reshaped (this is done inplace)

_isize0_ - The size of the first dimension

_isize1_ - The size of the second dimension (0 for 1D arrays). _Defaults to 0_

## Examples

Here is an example of the reshapearray opcode. It uses the file [reshapearray.csd](../../examples/reshapearray.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the reshapearray opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/reshapearray.csd"
```

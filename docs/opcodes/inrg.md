# inrg
Reads audio from a range of adjacent audio channels from the audio input device.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
inrg kstart, ain1 [,ain2, ain3, ..., ainN]
```

### Performance

_kstart_ - the number of the first channel of the input device to be accessed (channel numbers starts with 1, which is the first channel)

_ain1, ain2, ... ainN_ - the output arguments filled with the incoming audio coming from corresponding channels.

_inrg_ allows input from a range of adjacent channels from the input device. _kstart_ indicates the first channel to be accessed (channel 1 is the first channel). The user must be sure that the number obtained by summing _kstart_ plus the number of accessed channels -1 is &lt;= [nchnls_i](../../opcodes/nchnls_i).

# chnset
Writes data to a channel of the named software bus.

Implies declaring the channel with _imod_=2 (see also [chn_k, chn_a, and chn_S](../../opcodes/chn)).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
chnset ival, Sname
chnset kval, Sname
chnset aval, Sname
chnset Sval, Sname
chnsetks Sval, Sname
chnseti ival[], []Sname
chnsetk kval[], []Sname
chnseta aval[], []Sname
chnsets Sval[], []Sname
```

### Initialization

_Sname_ -- a string that indicates which named channel of the software bus to write.

_Sname[]_ -- an array of string that indicates which named channels of the software bus to write to.

_ival_ -- the control value to write at i-time.

_ival[]_ -- an array of control values to write at i-time.

_Sval_ -- the string value to write at i-time.

_Sval[]_ -- an array of string values to write at i-time.

### Performance

_kval_ -- the control value to write at performance time.

_aval_ -- the audio signal to write at performance time.

_Sval_ -- the string value to write at perf-time. The opcode chnset with strings works at both i- and perf-time, whereas chnsetks works only a perf-time. Channel contents are only updated if the string variable is modified.

_kval[]_ -- an array of control values to write at performance time.

_aval[]_ -- an array of audio vectors to write at performance time.

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Although it is possible to loop through channel names from an array with _chnget_ and _chnset_, using the array based channel opcodes is more efficient.

## Example

The example shows the software bus being used to write pitch information to a controlling program.

``` csound-orc linenums="1"
sr = 44100
kr = 100
ksmps = 1

instr   1
    a1    in
    kp,ka pitchamdf a1
          chnset    kp, "pitch"
endin
```

Here is another example of the chnset opcode. It uses the file [chnset.csd](../../examples/chnset.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the chnset opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/chnset.csd"
```

# dcblock
Implements the DC blocking filter

```
Y[i] = X[i] - X[i-1] + (igain * Y[i-1])
```

Based on work by Perry Cook.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares dcblock ain [, igain]
```

### Initialization

_igain_ -- the gain of the filter, which defaults to 0.99

### Performance

_ain_ -- audio signal input

> :memo: **Note**
>
> The new [dcblock2](../../opcodes/dcblock2) opcode is an improved method of removing DC from an audio signal.

## Examples

The result can be viewed in a graphical audio editor program like _audacity_. _audacity_ is available for Linux, Windows, and the MacOS and may be downloaded from [http://audacity.sourceforge.net](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).

Here is an example of the dcblock opcode. It uses the file [dcblock.csd](../../examples/dcblock.csd), and [drumsMlp.wav](../../examples/drumsMlp.wav).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the dcblock opcode." linenums="1"

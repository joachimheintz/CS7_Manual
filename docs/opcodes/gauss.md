# gauss
Gaussian distribution random number generator.

This is an x-class noise generator.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares gauss krange
ires gauss irange
kres gauss krange
ares gauss kmean, ksdev
ires gauss imean, isdev
kres gauss kmean, ksdev

```

### Performance

_krange_ -- the range of the random numbers (-_krange_ to +_krange_). Outputs both positive and negative numbers.

_kmean_ -- normal distribution mean.

_ksdev_ -- normal distribution standard deviation.

The first version of _gauss_ returns random numbers following a normal distribution centered around 0.0 (mu = 0.0) with a variance (sigma) of _krange_ / 3.83. Thus more than 99.99% of the random values generated are in the range -_krange_ to +_krange_. If a mean value different of 0.0 is desired, this mean value has to be added to the generated numbers (see example below).

The second version takes mean and standard deviation as parameters. They use the more mathematically sound Box-Muller algorithm to compute the normal distribution.

## Examples

Here is an example of the gauss opcode. It uses the file [gauss.csd](../../examples/gauss.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the gauss opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/gauss.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
mean = 0.000, std = 0.260, samples inside the given range: 99.993%
mean = 0.005, std = 0.999, samples inside the given range: 99.998%
mean = 2.700, std = 1.497, samples inside the given range: 100.000%
```

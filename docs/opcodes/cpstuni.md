# cpstuni
Returns micro-tuning values at init-rate.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
icps cpstuni index, ifn
```

### Initialization

_icps_ -- Return value in cycles per second.

_index_ -- An integer number denoting an index of scale.

_ifn_ -- Function table containing the parameters (numgrades, interval, basefreq, basekeymidi) and the tuning ratios.

### Performance

These opcodes are similar to [cpstmid](../../opcodes/cpstmid), but work without necessity of MIDI.

_cpstuni_ works at init-rate. It allows fully customized micro-tuning scales. It requires a function table number containing the tuning ratios, and some other parameters stored in the function table itself.

The _index_ argument should be filled with integer numbers expressing the grade of given scale to be converted in cps. The function table _ifn_ should be generated by [GEN02](../../scoregens/gen02) and the first four values stored in this function are parameters that express:

* numgrades -- The number of grades of the micro-tuning scale.
* interval -- The frequency range covered before repeating the grade ratios, for example 2 for one octave, 1.5 for a fifth etcetera.
* basefreq -- The base frequency of the scale in cycles per second.
* basekey -- The integer index of the scale to which to assign basefreq unmodified.

After these four values, the user can begin to insert the tuning ratios.  For example, for a standard 12-grade scale with the base-frequency of 261 cps assigned to the key-number 60, the corresponding f-statement in the score to generate the table should be:

``` csound-sco
;           numgrades    basefreq     tuning-ratios (eq.temp) .......
;                  interval    basekey
f1 0 64 -2  12     2     261   60     1   1.059463 1.12246 1.18920 ..etc...
```

Another example with a 24-grade scale with a base frequency of 440 assigned to the key-number 48, and a repetition interval of 1.5:

``` csound-sco
;                  numgrades       basefreq      tuning-ratios .......
;                          interval       basekey
f1 0 64 -2         24      1.5     440    48     1   1.01  1.02  1.03   ..etc...
```

## Examples

Here is an example of the cpstuni opcode. It uses the file [cpstuni.csd](../../examples/cpstuni.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the cpstuni opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/cpstuni.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 1:  i1 = 440.110
```

# mandol
An emulation of a mandolin.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares mandol kamp, kfreq, kpluck, kdetune, kgain, ksize \
            [, ifn] [, iminfreq]
```

### Initialization

_ifn_ -- table number containing the pluck wave form. The file [mandpluk.aiff](../../examples/mandpluk.aiff) is suitable for this. It is also available at [ftp://ftp.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/documentation/sounds/modelling/](ftp://ftp.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/documentation/sounds/modelling/).

_iminfreq_ (optional, default=0) -- Lowest frequency to be played on the note. If it is omitted it is taken to be the same as the initial _kfreq_.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of note.

_kfreq_ -- Frequency of note played.

_kpluck_ -- The pluck position, in range 0 to 1. Suggest 0.4.

_kdetune _ -- The proportional detuning between the two strings. Suggested range 0.9 to 1.

_kgain_ -- the loop gain of the model, in the range 0.97 to 1.

_ksize_ -- The size of the body of the mandolin. Range 0 to 2.

## Examples

Here is an example of the mandol opcode. It uses the file [mandol.csd](../../examples/mandol.csd), and [mandpluk.aiff](../../examples/mandpluk.aiff).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the mandol opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/mandol.csd"

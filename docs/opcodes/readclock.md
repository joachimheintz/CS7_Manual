# readclock
Reads the value of an internal clock.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ir readclock inum
```

### Initialization

_inum_ -- the number of a clock.  There are 32 clocks numbered 0 through 31. All other values are mapped to clock number 32.

_ir_ -- value at i-time, of the clock specified by _inum_

### Performance

Between a [clockon](../../opcodes/clockon) and a [clockoff](../../opcodes/clockoff) opcode, the CPU time used is accumulated in the clock. The precision is machine dependent but is the millisecond range on UNIX and Windows systems. The _readclock_ opcde reads the current value of a clock at initialization time.

## Examples

Here is an example of the readclock opcode. It uses the file [readclock.csd](../../examples/readclock.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the readclock opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/readclock.csd"
```

Its output should include lines like this:

```
instr 1:  i1 = 0.000
instr 1:  i1 = 90.000
instr 1:  i1 = 180.000
```

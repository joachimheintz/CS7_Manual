# osciliktp
A linearly interpolated oscillator that allows allows phase modulation.  
  
_osciliktp_ allows phase modulation (which is actually implemented as k-rate frequency modulation, by differentiating phase input). The disadvantage is that there is no amplitude control, and frequency can be varied only at the control-rate. This opcode can be faster or slower than  [oscilikt](../../opcodes/oscilikt) , depending on the control-rate.  
  

## Syntax
```csound-orc
    ares osciliktp kcps, kfn, kphs [, istor]
```

### Initialization
  
_istor_ (optional, defaults to 0) -- Skips initialization.  
  

### Performance
  
_ares_ -- audio-rate ouptut signal.  
  
_kcps_ -- frequency in Hz. Zero and negative values are allowed. However, the absolute value must be less than  [sr](../../opcodes/sr)  (and recommended to be less than _sr_/2).  
  
_kfn_ -- function table number. Can be varied at control rate (useful to morph 
waveforms, or select from a set of band-limited tables generated by  [GEN30](../../scoregens/gen30) ).  
  
_kphs_ -- phase (k-rate), the expected range is 0 to 1. The absolute value of the difference of the current and previous value of _kphs_ must be less than  [ksmps](../../opcodes/ksmps) .  
  

## Examples
Here is an example of the osciliktp opcode. It uses the file [osciliktp.csd](../../examples/osciliktp.csd).

# vdelay
An interpolating variable time delay.

It is not very different from the existing implementation ([deltapi](../../opcodes/deltapi)), it is only easier to use.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares vdelay asig, adel, imaxdel [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_imaxdel_ -- Maximum value of delay in milliseconds. If _adel_ gains a value greater than _imaxdel_ it is folded around _imaxdel_. This should not happen.

_iskip_ -- Skip initialization if present and non-zero

### Performance

With this unit generator it is possible to do Doppler effects or chorusing and flanging.

_asig_ -- Input signal.

_adel_ -- Current value of delay in milliseconds. Note that linear functions have no pitch change effects. Fast changing values of _adel_ will cause discontinuities in the waveform resulting noise.

## Examples

Here is an example of the vdelay opcode. It uses the file [vdelay.csd](../../examples/vdelay.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the vdelay opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/vdelay.csd"
```

Two important points here. First, the delay time must be always positive. And second, even though the delay time can be controlled in k-rate, it is not advised to do so, since sudden time changes will create clicks.

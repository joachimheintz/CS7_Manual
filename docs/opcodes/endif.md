# endif
Closes a block of code that begins with an ["if...then"](../../opcodes/if) statement.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
endif
```

### Performance

Any block of code that begins with an ["if...then"](../../opcodes/if) statement must end with an _endif_ statement.

## Examples

Here is an example of the endif opcode. It uses the file [endif.csd](../../examples/endif.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the endif opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/endif.csd"
```

# release
Indicates whether a note is in its _release_ stage.

Provides a way of knowing when a note off message for the current note is received. Only a noteoff message with the same MIDI note number as the one which triggered the note will be reported by _release_.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kflag release
```

### Performance

_kflag_ -- indicates whether the note is in its _release_ stage. (1 if a note off is received, otherwise 0)

_release_ outputs current note state. If current note is in the _release_ stage (i.e. if its duration has been extended with [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim) opcode and if it has only just deactivated), then the _kflag_ output argument is set to 1. Otherwise (in sustain stage of current note), _kflag_ is set to 0.

This opcode is useful for implementing complex release-oriented envelopes. When used in conjunction with [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim) it can provide an alternative to the hard-coded behaviour of the "r" opcodes ([linsegr](../../opcodes/linsegr), [expsegr](../../opcodes/expsegr) et al), where release time is set to the longest time specified in the active instrument.

## Examples

See the examples for [xtratim](../../opcodes/xtratim).

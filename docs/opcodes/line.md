# line
Trace a straight line between specified points.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
ares line ia, idur, ib
kres line ia, idur, ib
```

### Initialization
_ia_ -- starting value.

_ib_ -- value after _idur_ seconds.

_idur_ -- duration in seconds of segment. A zero or negative value will cause all initialization to be skipped.

### Performance
_line_ generates control or audio signals whose values move linearly from an initial value to a final one.
  
> :memo: **Note**
> 
>  A common error with this opcode is to assume that the value of _ib_ is held after the time _idur1_. _line_ does not automatically end or stop at the end of the duration given. If your note length is longer than _idur_ seconds, _kres_ (or _ares_) will not come to rest at _ib_, but will instead continue to rise or fall with the same rate. If a rise (or fall) and then hold is required that the _linseg_ opcode should be considered instead.

## Examples
Here is an example of the line opcode. It uses the file [line.csd](../../examples/line.csd).
``` csound-orc title="Example of the line opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/line.csd"
```

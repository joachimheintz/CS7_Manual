# marimba
Physical model related to the striking of a wooden block as found in a marimba.

The method is a physical model developed from Perry Cook but re-coded for Csound.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares marimba kamp, kfreq, ihrd, ipos, imp, kvibf, kvamp, ivibfn, idec \
             [, idoubles] [, itriples]
```

### Initialization

_ihrd_ -- the hardness of the stick used in the strike. A range of 0 to 1 is used. 0.5 is a suitable value.

_ipos_ -- where the block is hit, in the range 0 to 1.

_imp_ -- a table of the strike impulses. The file [marmstk1.wav](../../examples/marmstk1.wav) is a suitable function from measurements and can be loaded with a [GEN01](../../scoregens/gen01) table. It is also available at [ftp://ftp.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/documentation/sounds/modelling/](ftp://ftp.cs.bath.ac.uk/pub/dream/documentation/sounds/modelling/).

_ivfn_ -- shape of vibrato, usually a sine table, created by a function

_idec_ --  time before end of note when damping is introduced

_idoubles_ (optional) -- percentage of double strikes. Default is 40%.

_itriples_ (optional) -- percentage of triple strikes. Default is 20%.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of note.

_kfreq_ -- Frequency of note played.

_kvibf_ -- frequency of vibrato in Hertz. Suggested range is 0 to 12

_kvamp_ -- amplitude of the vibrato

## Examples

Here is an example of the marimba opcode. It uses the file [marimba.csd](../../examples/marimba.csd), and [marmstk1.wav](../../examples/marmstk1.wav).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the marimba opcode." linenums="1"

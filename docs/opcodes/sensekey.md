# sensekey
Returns the ASCII code of a key that has been pressed, or -1 if no key has been pressed.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kres[, kkeydown] sensekey
```

### Performance

_kres_ - returns the ASCII value of a key which is pressed or released.

_kkeydown_ - returns 1 if the key was pressed, 0 if it was released or if there is no key event.

_kres_ can be used to read keyboard events from stdin and returns the ASCII value of any key that is pressed or released, or it returns -1 when there is no keyboard activity. The value of _kkeydown_ is 1 when a key was pressed, or 0 otherwise. This behavior is emulated by default, so a key release is generated immediately after every key press. To have full functionality, FLTK can be used to capture keyboard events. [FLpanel](../../opcodes/flpanel) can be used to capture keyboard events and send them to the sensekey opcode, by adding an additional optional argument. See [FLpanel](../../opcodes/flpanel) for more information.

> This opcode can also be written as [sense](../../opcodes/sense).

## Examples

Here is an example of the sensekey opcode. It uses the file [sensekey.csd](../../examples/sensekey.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the sensekey opcode." linenums="1"

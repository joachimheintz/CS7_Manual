# repluck
Physical model of the plucked string.

A user can control the pluck point, the pickup point, the filter, and an additional audio signal, _axcite_. _axcite_ is used to excite the 'string'. Based on the Karplus-Strong algorithm.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares repluck iplk, kamp, icps, kpick, krefl, axcite
```

### Initialization

_iplk_ -- The point of pluck is _iplk_, which is a fraction of the way up the string (0 to 1). A pluck point of zero means no initial pluck.

_icps_  -- The string plays at _icps_ pitch.

### Performance

_kamp_ -- Amplitude of note.

_kpick_ -- Proportion of the way along the string to sample the output.

_krefl_ -- the coefficient of reflection, indicating the lossiness and the rate of decay. It must be strictly between 0 and 1 (it will complain about both 0 and 1).

### Performance

_axcite_ -- A signal which excites the string.

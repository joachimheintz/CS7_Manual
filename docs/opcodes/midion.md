# midion
Generates MIDI note messages at k-rate.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
midion kchn, knum, kvel
```

### Performance

_kchn_ -- MIDI channel number (1-16)

_knum_ -- note number (0-127)

_kvel_ -- velocity (0-127)

_midion_ (k-rate note on) plays MIDI notes with current _kchn_, _knum_ and _kvel_. These arguments can be varied at k-rate. Each time the MIDI converted value of any of these arguments changes, last MIDI note played by current instance of _midion_ is immediately turned off and a new note with the new argument values is activated. This opcode, as well as _moscil_, can generate very complex melodic textures if controlled by complex k-rate signals.

Any number of _midion_ opcodes can appear in the same Csound instrument, allowing a counterpoint-style polyphony within a single instrument.

## Examples

Here is a simple example of the midion opcode. It uses the file [midion_simple.csd](../../examples/midion_simple.csd).

This example generates a minor chord over every note received on the MIDI input. It generates MIDI notes on csound's MIDI output, so be sure to connect something.

```

Here is another example of the midion opcode. It uses the file [midion_scale.csd](../../examples/midion_scale.csd).

This example generates random notes from a given scale for every note received on the MIDI input. It generates MIDI notes on csound's MIDI output, so be sure to connect something.

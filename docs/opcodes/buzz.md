# buzz
Output is a set of harmonically related sine partials.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares buzz xamp, xcps, knh, ifn [, iphs]
```

### Initialization

_ifn_ -- table number of a stored function containing a sine wave. A large table of at least 8192 points is recommended.

_iphs_ (optional, default=0) -- initial phase of the fundamental frequency, expressed as a fraction of a cycle (0 to 1). A negative value will cause phase initialization to be skipped. The default value is zero

### Performance

_xamp_ -- amplitude

_xcps_ -- frequency in cycles per second

The _buzz_ units generate an additive set of harmonically related cosine partials of fundamental frequency _xcps_, and whose amplitudes are scaled so their summation peak equals _xamp_. The selection and strength of partials is determined by the following control parameters:

_knh_ -- total number of harmonics requested. New in Csound version 3.57, _knh_ defaults to one. If _knh_ is negative, the absolute value is used.

_buzz_ and [gbuzz](../../opcodes/gbuzz) are useful as complex sound sources in subtractive synthesis. _buzz_ is a special case of the more general _gbuzz_ in which _klh_ = _kmul_ = 1; it thus produces a set of _knh_ equal-strength harmonic partials, beginning with the fundamental. (This is a band-limited pulse train; if the partials extend to the Nyquist, i.e. _knh_ = int (sr / 2 / fundamental freq.), the result is a real pulse train of amplitude _xamp_.)

Although _knh_ may be varied during performance, its internal value is necessarily integer and may cause &#8220;pops&#8221; due to discontinuities in the output. _buzz_ can be amplitude- and/or frequency-modulated by either control or audio signals.

N.B. This unit has its analog in [GEN11](../../scoregens/gen11), in which the same set of cosines can be stored in a function table for sampling by an oscillator. Although computationally more efficient, the stored pulse train has a fixed spectral content, not a time-varying one as above.

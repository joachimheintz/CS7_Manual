# timout
Conditional branch during p-time depending on elapsed note time.

_istrt_ and _idur_ specify time in seconds. The branch to _label_ will become effective at time _istrt_, and will remain so for just _idur_ seconds. Note that _timout_ can be reinitialized for multiple activation within a single note (see example under [reinit](../../opcodes/reinit)).

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
timout istrt, idur, label
```

where _label_ is in the same instrument block and is not an expression.

## Examples

Here is an example of the timout opcode. It uses the file [timout.csd](../../examples/timout.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the timout opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/timout.csd"
```

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
soundouts  asigl, asigr, ifilcod [, iformat]
```

### Initialization

_ifilcod_ -- integer or character-string denoting the destination soundfile name. An integer denotes the file soundout.ifilcod; a character-string (in double quotes, spaces permitted) gives the filename itself, optionally a full pathname. If not a full path, the named file is written relative to the directory given by the SFDIR environment variable if defined, or the current directory. See also [GEN01](../../scoregens/gen01).

_iformat_ (optional, default=0) -- specifies the audio data file format:

*  1 = 8-bit signed char (high-order 8 bits of a 16-bit integer)
*  4 = 16-bit short integers
*  5 = 32-bit long integers
*  6 = 32-bit floats

If _iformat_ = 0 it is taken from the Csound [-o](../../) command-line flag. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_soundouts_ writes stereo audio output to a disk file in raw (headerless) format without 0dBFS scaling. The expected range of the audio signals depends on the selected sample format.

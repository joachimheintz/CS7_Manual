# oscilikt
A linearly interpolated oscillator that allows changing the table number at k-rate.

_oscilikt_ is very similar to [oscili](../../opcodes/oscili), but allows changing the table number at k-rate. It is slightly slower than _oscili_ (especially with high control rate), although also more accurate as it uses a 31-bit phase accumulator, as opposed to the 24-bit one used by _oscili_.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares oscilikt xamp, xcps, kfn [, iphs] [, istor]
kres oscilikt kamp, kcps, kfn [, iphs] [, istor]
```

### Initialization

_iphs_ (optional, defaults to 0) -- initial phase in the range 0 to 1. Other values are wrapped to the allowed range.

_istor_ (optional, defaults to 0) -- skip initialization.

### Performance

_kamp_, _xamp_ -- amplitude.

_kcps_, _xcps_ -- frequency in Hz. Zero and negative values are allowed. However, the absolute value must be less than [sr](../../opcodes/sr) (and recommended to be less than _sr_/2).

_kfn_ -- function table number. Can be varied at control rate (useful to <quote>morph</quote> waveforms, or select from a set of band-limited tables generated by [GEN30](../../scoregens/gen30)).

## Examples

Here is an example of the oscilikt opcode. It uses the file [oscilikt.csd](../../examples/oscilikt.csd).

``` csound-orc title="Example of the oscilikt opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/oscilikt.csd"
```

# prepiano
Creates a tone similar to a piano string prepared in a Cageian fashion.

Audio output is a tone similar to a piano string, prepared with a number of rubbers and rattles. The method uses a physical model developed from solving the partial differential equation.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares prepiano ifreq, iNS, iD, iK, iT30, iB, kbcl, kbcr, imass, ihvfreq, \
              iinit, ipos, ivel, isfreq, isspread[, irattles, irubbers]
al, ar prepiano  ifreq, iNS, iD, iK, iT30, iB, kbcl, kbcr, imass, ihvfreq, \
                 iinit, ipos, ivel, isfreq, isspread[, irattles, irubbers]
```

### Initialization

_ifreq_ -- The base frequency of the string.

_iNS_ -- the number of strings involved.  In a real piano 1, 2 or 3 strings are found in different frequency regions.

_iD_ -- the amount each string other that the first is detuned from the main frequency, measured in cents.

_iK_ -- dimensionless stiffness parameter.

_iT30_ -- 30 db decay time in seconds.

_ib_ -- high-frequency loss parameter (keep this small).

_imass_ -- the mass of the piano hammer.

_ihvfreq_ -- the frequency of the natural vibrations of the hammer.

_iinit_ -- the initial position of the hammer.

_ipos_ -- position along the string that the strike occurs.

_ivel_ -- normalized strike velocity.

_isfreq_ -- scanning frequency of the reading place.

_isspread_ -- scanning frequency spread.

_irattles_ -- table number giving locations of any rattle(s).

_irubbers_ -- table number giving locations of any rubbers(s).

The rattles and rubbers tables are collections of four values, preceeded by a count. In the case of a rattle the four are position, mass density ratio of rattle/string, frequency of rattle and vertical length of the rattle.  For the rubber the fours are position, mass density ratio of rubber/string, frequency of rubber and the loss parameter.

### Performance

A note is played on a piano string, with the arguments as below.

_kbcL_ -- Boundary condition at left end of string (1 is clamped, 2 pivoting and 3 free).

_kbcR_ -- Boundary condition at right end of string (1 is clamped, 2 pivoting and 3 free).

Note that changing the boundary conditions during playing may lead to glitches and is made available as an experiment.

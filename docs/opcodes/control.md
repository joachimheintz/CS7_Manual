# control
Configurable slider controls for realtime user input. Requires Winsound or TCL/TK. It reads a slider's value.

Plugin opcode in control.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kres control knum
```

### Performance

Note that this opcode is not available on Windows due to the implimentation of pipes on that system.

_knum_ -- number of the slider to be read.

Calling _control_ will create a new slider on the screen. There is no theoretical limit to the number of sliders. Windows and TCL/TK use only integers for slider values, so the values may need rescaling. GUIs usually pass values at a fairly slow rate, so it may be advisable to pass the output of control through _port_.

## Examples

See the [setctrl](../../opcodes/setctrl) opcode for an example.

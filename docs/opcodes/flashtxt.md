# flashtxt
Allows text to be displayed from instruments like sliders etc.

Plugin opcode in control. Only on Unix and Windows at present.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
flashtxt  iwhich, String
```

### Initialization

_iwhich_ -- the number of the window.

_String_ -- the string to be displayed.

### Performance

Note that this opcode is not available on Windows due to the implimentation of pipes on that system

A window is created, identified by the iwhich argument, with the text string displayed.  If the text is replaced by a number then the window id deleted.  Note that the text windows are globally numbered so different instruments can change the text, and the window survives the instance of the instrument.

## Examples

Here is an example of the flashtxt opcode. It uses the file [flashtxt.csd](../../examples/flashtxt.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the flashtxt opcode." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/flashtxt.csd"
```

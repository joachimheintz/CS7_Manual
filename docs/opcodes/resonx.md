# resonx
Emulates a stack of filters using the reson opcode.

_resonx_ is equivalent to a filters consisting of more layers of [reson](../../opcodes/reson) with the same arguments, serially connected. Using a stack of a larger number of filters allows a sharper cutoff. They are faster than using a larger number instances in a Csound orchestra of the old opcodes, because only one initialization and k- cycle are needed at time and the audio loop falls entirely inside the cache memory of processor.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares resonx asig, xcf, xbw [, inumlayer] [, iscl] [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_inumlayer_ (optional) -- number of elements in the filter stack. Default value is 4.

_iscl_ (optional, default=0) -- coded scaling factor for resonators. A value of 1 signifies a peak response factor of 1, i.e. all frequencies other than kcf are attenuated in accordance with the (normalized) response curve. A value of 2 raises the response factor so that its overall RMS value equals 1. (This intended equalization of input and output power assumes all frequencies are physically present; hence it is most applicable to white noise.) A zero value signifies no scaling of the signal, leaving that to some later adjustment (see [balance](../../opcodes/balance)). The default value is 0.

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- initial disposition of internal data space. Since filtering incorporates a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of the storage space used is significant. A zero value will clear the space; a non-zero value will allow previous information to remain. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_asig_ -- input signal

_xcf_ -- the center frequency of the filter, or frequency position of the peak response.

_xbw_ -- bandwidth of the filter (the Hz difference between the upper and lower half-power points)

## Examples

Here is an example of the resonx opcodes. It uses the file [resonx.csd](../../examples/resonx.csd).

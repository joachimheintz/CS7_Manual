# logcurve
This opcode implements a formula for generating a normalised logarithmic curve in range 0 - 1. It is based on the Max / MSP work of Eric Singer (c) 1994.

Generates a logarithmic curve in range 0 to 1 of arbitrary steepness. Steepness index less than 1.0 would result in Not-a-Number errors and cause unstable behavior, so it is treated as if it were 1.
  
The formula used to calculate the curve is:

```
log(x * (y-1)+1) / log(y)
```

where x is equal to _kindex_ and y is equal to _ksteepness_.

## Syntax
```csound-orc
kout logcurve kindex, ksteepness
```

### Performance
_kindex_ -- Index value. Expected range 0 to 1.

_ksteepness_ -- Steepness of the generated curve. Values closer to 1.0 result in a straighter line while larger values steepen the curve.

_kout_ -- Scaled output.

## Examples
Here is an example of the logcurve opcode. It uses the file [logcurve.csd](../../examples/logcurve.csd).

ir tival

### Initialization

Puts the value of the instrument's internal &#8220;tie-in&#8221; flag into the named i-rate variable. Assigns 1 if this note has been &#8220;tied&#8221; onto a previously held note (see [i statement](../../scoregens/i)); assigns 0 if no tie actually took place. (See also [tigoto](../../opcodes/tigoto).)

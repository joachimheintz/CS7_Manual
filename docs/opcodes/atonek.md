# atonek
A hi-pass filter whose transfer functions are the complements of the [tonek](../../opcodes/tonek) opcode.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
kres atonek ksig, khp [, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- initial disposition of internal data space. Since filtering incorporates a feedback loop of previous output, the initial status of the storage space used is significant. A zero value will clear the space; a non-zero value will allow previous information to remain. The default value is 0.

### Performance

_kres_ -- the output signal at control-rate.

_ksig_ -- the input signal at control-rate.

_khp_ --  the response curve's half-power point, in Hertz. Half power is defined as peak power / root 2.

_atonek_ is a filter whose transfer functions is the complement of [tonek](../../opcodes/tonek). _atonek_ is thus a form of high-pass filter whose transfer functions represent the &#8220;filtered out&#8221; aspects of their complements. However, power scaling is not normalized in _atonek_ but remains the true complement of the corresponding unit.

## Examples

Here is an example of the atonek opcode. It uses the file [atonek.csd](../../examples/atonek.csd).

# moogvcf
A digital emulation of the Moog diode ladder filter configuration.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
ares moogvcf asig, xfco, xres [,iscale, iskip]
```

### Initialization

_iscale_ (optional, default=1) -- internal scaling factor. Use if _asig_ is not in the range +/-1. Input is first divided by _iscale_, then output is mutliplied _iscale_. Default value is 1. (New in Csound version 3.50)

_iskip_ (optional, default=0) -- if non zero skip the initialisation of the filter. (New in Csound version 4.23f13 and 5.0)

### Performance

_asig_ -- input signal

_xfco_ -- filter cut-off frequency in Hz. As of version 3.50, may i-,k-, or a-rate.

_xres_ -- amount of resonance. Self-oscillation occurs when _xres_ is approximately one. As of version 3.50, may a-rate, i-rate, or k-rate.

_moogvcf_ is a digital emulation of the Moog diode ladder filter configuration. This emulation is based loosely on the paper &#8220;Analyzing the Moog VCF with Considerations for Digital Implementation&#8221; by Stilson and Smith (CCRMA). This version was originally coded in Csound by Josep Comajuncosas. Some modifications and conversion to C were done by Hans Mikelson.

> Before version 6.02 this filter required that the input signal be normalized to one. This can be easily achieved using [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs), like this:

> You can also use [moogvcf2](../../opcodes/moogvcf2) which defaults scaling to [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs).

## Examples

Here is an example of the moogvcf opcode. It uses the file [moogvcf.csd](../../examples/moogvcf.csd).

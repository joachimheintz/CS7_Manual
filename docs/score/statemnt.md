# **Score Statements**

The statements used in scores are:

* [a](../../scoregens/a) - Advance score time by a specified amount
* [b](../../scoregens/b) - Resets the clock
* [capB](../../scoregens/B) - Accumulate clock adjustment
* [C](../../scoregens/C) - Toggles carry facility
* [d](../../scoregens/d) - Deletes an infinite instrument
* [e](../../scoregens/e) - Marks the end of the last section of the score
* [f](../../scoregens/f) - Causes a [GEN subroutine](ScoreGenRef) to place values in a stored function table
* [i](../../scoregens/i) - Makes an instrument active at a specific time and for a certain duration
* [m](../../scoregens/m) - Sets a named mark in the score
* [n](../../scoregens/n) - Repeats a section
* [q](../../scoregens/q) - Used to quiet an instrument
* [r](../../scoregens/r) - Starts a repeated section
* [s](../../scoregens/s) - Marks the end of a section
* [t](../../scoregens/t) - Sets the tempo
* [v](../../scoregens/v) - Provides for locally variable time warping of score events
* [x](../../scoregens/x) - Skip the rest of the current section
* [y](../../scoregens/y) - Set seed for random numbers, either from p1 or, if omitted, the clock
* [leftbrace](../../scoregens/{) - Begins a non-sectional, nestable loop.
* [rightbrace](../../scoregens/}) - Ends a non-sectional, nestable loop.

Comments are denoted by semicolon (;), double slash (//) or the character c and last until a newline. Also C-style comments /\* ... \*/ are allowed.

# Durations in Instrument Events

The third parameter field in an instrument event (accessible as `p3` in the called instrument) sets the duration of the instrument instance. However, there are some notable cases and features.

## Duration in Score vs. Realtime Events: Beats vs. Seconds

### Instrument Events Given in the Standard Numeric Score

If an instrument is called via the score, both `p2` (start time) and `p3` (duration) are measured in *beats*. Per default, one beat is in tempo 60 beats per minute, so one second. But it is affected by the tempo statement which can be given via the `t` statement. So without any tempo statement this score will result in one second performance of instrument 1, then one second pause, and thene again one second performance:

```csound
<CsScore>
i 1 0 1
i 1 2 1
</CsScore>
```

Setting the tempo to 120 bpm, instrument 1 will play for 0.5 seconds, followed by a pause of 0.5 seconds, and then again 0.5 seconds performance of instrument 1:

```csound
<CsScore>
t 0 120
i 1 0 1
i 1 2 1
</CsScore>
```

### Instrument Events Given in the Orchestra Code

If an instrument is called via an opcode in the Csound orchestra (typically `schedule` or `schedulek`), both `p2` and `p3` are not affected by any tempo statement in the score. They always measure time in seconds. So this code will always result in one second performance, one second pause, one second performance whatever the tempo be in the score:

```csound
<CsInstruments>
schedule(1,0,1)
schedule(1,2,1)
</CsInstruments>
```


## Overwriting the Duration in the Instrument

This is a simple but versatile feature. Any duration given by the note event can be overwritten inside the instrument:

```
instr 1
  p3 = 2
  aSig = oscili:a(.2,300)
  outall(aSig)
endin
schedule(1,0,100)
```

## Zero Duration

Calling an instrument with duration zero means that only the inilialization pass is executed.

```
instr 1
  // this will be printed
  prints("i-rate\n")
  // this will not be printed
  printks("k-rate\n",0)
endin
schedule(1,0,0)
```

## Negative Duration

### Legato or Tied Notes

Basically, negative duration (usually `-1`) was introduced into Csound as feature for tied notes. If one instance is called with a negative duration, the next call will continue this instance rather than invoking a new instance.

```
instr 1
  aSig = poscil:a(0.2,p4)
  outall(aSig)
endin
schedule(1,0,-1,400)
schedule(1,1.1,-1,500)
schedule(1,2.2,1,444)
```

## Allowing More Than One Instance 

It is possible to run several instances called by negative duration at the same time when these instances are called with different fractional numbers.

```
<CsoundSynthesizer> 
<CsOptions> 
-odac
</CsOptions> 
<CsInstruments> 
instr 1
  aSig = poscil:a(0dbfs/5,p4)
  outall(aSig)
endin
</CsInstruments> 
<CsScore>
// normal behaviour: only one instance
i 1 0 -1 400
i 1 1 -1 500
i 1 2  1 444
s
// explicit instances: simultaneous instances
i 1.01 1 -1 400
i 1.02 2 -1 500
i 1.03 3  1 444
</CsScore> 
</CsoundSynthesizer> 
```


### One Single Negative Duration 

If there is only one negative duration, the called instrument instance will play for an indefinite duration; in other words: as long as Csound is running.

```
<CsoundSynthesizer> 
<CsOptions> 
-odac
</CsOptions> 
<CsInstruments> 
instr 1
  aSig = poscil:a(0dbfs/5,400)
  outall(aSig)
endin
schedule(1,0,-1)
</CsInstruments> 
<CsScore>
</CsScore> 
</CsoundSynthesizer> 
```

This code runs "endlessly" because the score section is empty. Putting the note event in the score will terminate Csound immediately as -1 is no duration and the last score event defines the overall duration of Csound's performance.

```
<CsoundSynthesizer> 
<CsOptions> 
-odac
</CsOptions> 
<CsInstruments> 
instr 1
  aSig = poscil:a(0dbfs/5,400)
  outall(aSig)
endin
</CsInstruments> 
<CsScore>
i 1 0 -1
</CsScore> 
</CsoundSynthesizer> 
```

There must be a `e` or `f0` statement followed by a positive duration to prevent this termination.

```
<CsoundSynthesizer> 
<CsOptions> 
-odac
</CsOptions> 
<CsInstruments> 
instr 1
  aSig = poscil:a(0dbfs/5,400)
  outall(aSig)
endin
</CsInstruments> 
<CsScore>
i 1 0 -1
e 10
</CsScore> 
</CsoundSynthesizer> 
```


## Summary

1. If an instrument is called twice with negative duration, the second call will terminate the first instance.  
2. Only if fractional instrument numbers are used. several instances can be run simultaneously.  
3. One single instance will run as long as Csound runs.

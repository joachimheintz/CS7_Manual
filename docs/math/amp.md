# **Amplitude Converters**

Opcodes to convert between different amplitude measurements are:

* [ampdb](../../opcodes/ampdb)
* [ampdbfs](../../opcodes/ampdbfs)
* [db](../../opcodes/db)
* [dbamp](../../opcodes/dbamp)
* [dbfsamp](../../opcodes/dbfsamp)

Use [rms](../../opcodes/rms) to find the rms value of a signal. See also [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs) for another way to handle amplitudes in csound.

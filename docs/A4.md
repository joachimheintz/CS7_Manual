# A4

A4 â€” Sets the base frequency for pitch A4.

## Description
These statements are global value [assignments](assign.md), made at the beginning of an orchestra, before any instrument block is defined. Their function is to set certain [reserved symbol variables](VariableTypes.md) that are required for performance. Once set, these reserved symbols can be used in expressions anywhere in the orchestra.

## Syntax

``` csound-orc
A4 = iarg
```

## Initialization

*A4* = (optional) -- set reference frequency for pitch A4 to *iarg* Hertz. The default value is 440.

In addition, any [global variable](GlobalVariable.md) can be initialized by an *init-time assignment* anywhere before the first [instr statement](instr.md). All of the above assignments are run as instrument 0 (i-pass only) at the start of real performance.

Beginning with Csound version 6.08, *A4* may be used. It affects the behaviour of the opcodes *cpspch*, *cpsoct*, *cps2pch*, *cpsxpch* and *cpsmidinn*.

## Examples

Here is an example of the A4 opcode. It uses the file [A4.csd](A4.csd).

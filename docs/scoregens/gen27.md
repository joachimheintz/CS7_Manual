# GEN27
Construct functions from segments of straight lines in breakpoint fashion.

## Syntax
``` csound-orc
f # time size 27 x1  y1 x2 y2 x3 ...
```

### Initialization

_size_ -- number of points in the table. Must be a power of 2 or power-of-2 plus 1 (see [f statement](../../scoregens/f)).

_x1, x2, x3,_ etc. -- locations in table at which to attain the following y value. Must be in increasing order. If the last value is less than size, then the rest will be set to zero. Should not be negative but can be zero.

_y1, y2, y3,_, etc. -- Breakpoint values attained at the location specified by the preceding x value.

> :memo: **Note**
>
>  If p4 is positive, functions are post-normalized (rescaled to a maximum absolute value of 1 after generation). A negative p4 will cause rescaling to be skipped.

## Examples

Here is an example of the GEN27 generator. It uses the file [gen27.csd](../../examples/gen27.csd).

``` csound-csd title="Example of the GEN27 generator." linenums="1"
--8<-- "examples/gen27.csd"
```

This is the diagram of the waveform of the GEN27 routine, as used in the example:

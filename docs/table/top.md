# **Function Table Control**

Refer to the [f score statement](../../scoregens/f), [ftgen](../../opcodes/ftgen), [ftgentmp](../../opcodes/ftgentmp), [ftgenonce](../../opcodes/ftgenonce) and the [GEN Routines](../../score/genroutines) section for information on creating tables.

Tables can be removed from memory using the [ftfree](../../opcodes/ftfree) opcode.

Tables by default, require a size which is a power of two. However tables with any size can be generated by specifying the size as a negative number (see [f score statement](../../scoregens/f)).

> :memo: **Note**
>
> Not all opcodes accept tables whose size is not a power of two, as this may be a requirement for internal processing.

For information on table access, consult the section [Table Access](../../siggen/tableacc).

Tables for use with the [loscilx](../../opcodes/loscilx) opcode can be loaded using [sndload](../../opcodes/sndload).

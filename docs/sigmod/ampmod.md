# **Amplitude Modifiers and Dynamic processing**

The opcodes that modify amplitude are:

* [balance](../../opcodes/balance)
* [balance2](../../opcodes/balance2)
* [compress](../../opcodes/compress)
* [compress2](../../opcodes/compress2)
* [clip](../../opcodes/clip)
* [dam](../../opcodes/dam)
* [gain](../../opcodes/gain)

The opcode [0dbfs](../../opcodes/0dbfs) facilitates the use of amplitude by removing the need to use of explicit sample values.

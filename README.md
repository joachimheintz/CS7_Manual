This is the draft for a new introduction of the Csound Reference Manual.  
See the result online [here](https://joachimheintz.github.io/CS7_Manual/).

It uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for trying out the proposed changes.  
If you want to see local changes, run `mkdocs serve` in the doc directory. The site is then visible under `localhost:8000` in your browser.
